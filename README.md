# Board Game Rulebook Char-RNN

Fork of sherjilozair's [char-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow), a tensorflow recurrent neural network inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

Our contribution is a new dataset of board game rules and a network trained on that dataset. It can be retrained with different hyperparameters, as well.

## The Dataset
The dataset is a .txt file consisting of plaintext rules for many games from the [BoardGameGeek Top 100](https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) at the time of creation. We copy + pasted the rules manually into the plaintext file, and then removed artifacts by hand. We also created some uniform headings for sections of the different rulebooks: "COMPONENTS: " or "GAME NAME: ", for example. Some games were not able to be copied as PDF versions of the rulebook did not allow copy and paste functions.

## Requirements
- [Tensorflow 1.0](http://www.tensorflow.org)

## Basic Usage
To generate some rules, run `python sample.py`. You can also add some arguments to adjust the output:

`-n` determines the number of characters output.

`--sample` determines whether characters or words are produced: `sample=1` will generate output on the character level, leading to some nonsense words, whereas `sample=2` will produce only full words.

`--prime` determines prime text - you can start the generator off with some text of your own, which it will use to generate the rest of the text.

## Training the Network
To train the network, run `python train.py --data_dir=./data/rulebook`.

## Adjusting Input
As this uses sherjilozair's original model, you can swap out our dataset with any text file named "input.txt".
