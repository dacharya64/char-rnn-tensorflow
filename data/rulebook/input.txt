In a world very much like our own,
Millennium Blades is the world's most popular
collectible card game. Continuously in print
for more than a thousand years, the game has
seen countless expansions and untold billions
of cards in circulation.
Players from around the world and from all
walks of life seek to become world champions
by mastering duels and collecting the game's
rarest and most coveted cards. Still others
live by the game, building financial empires
by dealing, speculating, and trading in the
aftermarket. Many are content simply to play
for fun and meet new friends.
Your very own Millennium Blades Legend
is about to unfold! What will be your path to
glory? With your starter deck in hand and a
dream in your heart, the time has come to
step boldly into the world of Millennium
Blades!
We've all been touched by the magic of
collectible card games. When I was about
fourteen, a friend gave me my first Magic: the
Gathering Deck, and from that day, there was
no turning back. After spending countless
hours and dollars on the hobby and having
my gripes and disappointments along with
elations and inspirations, I've come to look
back fondly on those days. While I don't have
the time to collect and play that I used to, I
remember well the magic that brought these
games to life for me and my friends so many
years ago. I've tried my best to capture that
magic in Millennium Blades.
Millennium Blades is much different than
any game I've ever made, and it's likely to
be very different from anything you've ever
played. I hope that it captures the emotions
of playing a collectible card game: excitement,
desperation, discovery, hope, dread, and
camaraderie.
Most of all, I hope you have fun playing
Millennium Blades!

"Millennium Blades is adapted
from a game played thousands of
years ago by Celtic Druid-Kings. Except
that they dueled with real monsters
and spells and used them to fight
aliens from another dimension."

COMPONENTS:
- 5 Player Boards
- 2 Central Market Boards (Aftermarket, Store)
- 6 Starter Decks (9 cards each)
- 1 Core Set (118 cards)
- 11 Expansion Sets (12 cards each)
- 9 Premium Sets (12 cards each)
- 8 Master Sets (12 cards each)
- 4 Bronze Promo Sets (6 cards each)
- 3 Silver Promo Sets (6 cards each)
- 3 Gold Promo Sets (6 cards each)
- 6 Pro Player Card Sets (5 cards each)
- 6 Character Cards

Before your first game, you should
assemble the Millennium Dollars Money
Wads. To do this, form stacks of 5 copies
of identical bills. Take two stacks of 5, press
them together so the printed sides face
outward, and wrap them with one of the
appropriate strips of sticker paper from the
sticker sheet.
Using whole stacks of Millennium
Dollars brings to life the feeling of buying
and selling expensive collectible trading
cards on the aftermarket!
- Core Set
- 6 Starter Decks
- 6 Pro Player Card Sets
- 2 Meta Sets
- 9 Premium Sets
- 11 Expansion Sets
- 10 Promo Sets
- 8 Master Sets

SETUP:
1. Table Setup. Find a large table and set out
player boards for each of your players in the
game, then place the Store and Aftermarket
Mats in the middle of the table. Make sure that
each player has about 3-6 inches between his
area and the central boards, but not too much
more, as players will need to reach around the
table quite a bit and should be able to reach
both central boards easily.
2. Set Selection. Take the Core set, five
Expansion Sets, four Premium Sets, and three
Master Sets of your choice. Shuffle all thirteen
of these together to form the Store.
3. Set Aside Promos.* Choose two sets of
Bronze and Silver Promos, and one set of Gold
Promos, for a total of five sets. Place one of
each type of set in the Card Fusion Area, and
set the other two aside to use as Prize Support
later on.
4. Setup Metagame. Shuffle the 2 stacks of
Metagame Cards separately, then place them
into their slots on the Aftermarket Board.
5. Distribute Starting Items. Give each
player a starter deck, either randomly or of
their choice, 3 cards from the top of the store
deck, a Character Card**, either randomly or
of their choice, 3 Sell Markers of a color (4 if
there are only three players), and 6 Friendship
cards of their character.
6. Supplies. Set up a bank of Millennium
Dollars where players can reach them, but
where they won't accidentally be mixed in with
a player's own possessions.
*Backer Bonus Promo Rule. If you backed
Millennium Blades and have a Backer Card
in the game, you can start with that card in
your collection. If you do, each other player
gets a random card from that card's Set in their
collection.
** Playing without Characters. In your first
game, you may choose to leave out character
powers. In this case, players should still
pick a character, but ignore their character's
Deckbuilding and Tournament powers.
Each player gets the Character
Power Card and all Friendship
Cards for their chosen character.

Shuffle it all together to make the Store!

GAME FLOW:
Starting the Game
If you're new to Millennium Blades,
we recommend starting out by playing a
Pre-Release Tournament.
The Pre-Release Tournament is an optional
tournament round that is played before the
game starts. This is primarily designed to give
new players an opportunity to learn how decks
are played, so that they can evaluate cards and
build decks during the Deckbuilding Phase.
If all of your players have played
Millennium Blades before, you can skip the
Pre-Release Tournament and move to the first
round of Deckbuilding.
Pre-Release Tournament
This tournament is just like a normal
tournament, except for a few slight changes.
1. There is no Deckbuilding Phase. Players
play with only their starter decks.
2. No Metagame is revealed during this
tournament, and character powers are not
used.
3. There are very few points awarded for
this tournament.
4. If you choose to do a pre-release
tournament, skip the third round of
deckbuilding and the third tournament later
on in the game, so that there are still only
three tournaments in the game.
Millennium Blades is played over a series
of rounds. Each round has two parts, a
Deckbuilding Phase and a Tournament Phase.
In the Deckbuilding Phase, you will receive
new cards, as well as being able to buy, sell,
trade, and collect. After a certain time limit
passes, this phase ends and a tournament will
begin.
In the Tournament Phase, you will play
the deck you've built and try to collect more
Ranking Points (RP) than the other players.
Players will gain Victory Points (VP) by
placing highly in the tournaments, collecting
valuable sets, helping out the other players,
and amassing wealth by dealing through the
game's Aftermarket.
At the end of the last round, whoever has
the most VPs is declared the winner of the
game!
These rules assume a 3-5 player group. For
the 2 player rules, check the Variants section on
page 14.

OVERVIEW:
"A card game is an equation. There
are trillions of combinations of cards
to construct a deck, and millions of
constructions operated by millions of
agents. But the system is a finite one,
and so it is ultimately solvable."
- "Power Creep" Proposal Document
Designer's Note
(On Mistakes and Mis-plays)
Even though Millennium Blades
seems like a game of calculation and full
information on the surface, it's actually a
game of mental dexterity and skill.
In many games of strategy, we allow
players to go back and correct a mistake or to
replay a card when they have miscalculated.
It is critical that you do not allow players
to correct their mistakes in Millennium
Blades.
Millennium Blades is about dividing
the limited resources of your brainpower
among a variety of tasks, and weighing
where to best invest this resource. There's
not enough time to do everything, and so
you've got to make decisions about where to
use your best cards and where to invest your
time and attention.
Making a critical mis-play, forgetting to
turn in a collection, or neglecting to include
a key card in your deck are mistakes just like
missing a shot in soccer or dropping a catch
in baseball you can't step back and correct
these things. Instead, renew your focus,
and resolve not to make the same mistake
next round. The game has been built so
that you don't have to play every move
perfectly to win the game, and you'll have a
better experience if you just move on from
mistakes, rather than trying to fix them.
Cards move quickly, and there are
many copies of each card floating
around. You're better off attempting
to sell or trade for a card another
player wants than to withhold it or
fuse it. They're probably going to get
it one way or another, after all.
A pack of Millennium Blades
cards actually comes with 15 cards.
The commons and uncommons
have been abstracted out of the
game as Deck Boxes. All Singles
you acquire are rare or better.

FIRST GAME SETUP:
For your first game of Millennium
Blades, we recommend these sets, and that
you play without Character Powers:
Expansion: Fists of Steel, Obari as Hell,
Rubber Ducky Maid Crusaders R, 1001
Nights, Gno-Man's Land.
Premium: Cards Magica, AD 2400,
Clockwork Empire, Pandora's Box Opened.
Master: Symphony of Destruction,
Galactic Caboose, 006 Plus One.
Fusion Promo: Legend of Final Badass,
Princess Blade, Elemental Dragon Lords.
Prize Support: Elemental Blades, Sealed
Vaults.

COLLECTIONS:
Building your collections is a necessary step in becoming the most
prestigious Millennium Blades player among your friends. You can build
collections during the Deckbuilding Phase. Collections you turn in will be
lost, so be careful about what you include!
Deck
You will have the opportunity to build your deck freely during the
Deckbuilding Phase, including any cards that you feel will be useful to
you. More cards will become available each round, increasing your options
and the number of potential decks you can construct.
Metagame
In competitive card gaming, the meta is always changing, and so you will
need to watch the metagame as you play.
Each round, the metagame will shift. The Metagame gives significant
bonuses if you can incorporate it into your deck. Don't ignore it!
Aftermarket
Seek out wealth or hard-to-find cards by dealing in the Aftermarket!
Unlike the Store, cards in the Aftermarket are bought and sold face-up,
so you know exactly what you're going to get.
You can interact directly with the Aftermarket, and the bank pays you
right away when you put cards on sale, not when other players buy them.
You can browse through the Aftermarket and buy cards by paying their
costs to the bank directly.
Store
Buying packs from your friendly local game store is the easiest way to get
new cards for your collection!
Cards in the Store are face-down, so you will only know what set they are
from when you buy them. Will this pack have the card you've been searching
for, or will it set you on the path of pursuing an unforeseen strategy?
Binder
The Binder is where you keep your cards that are not being used in your
deck or collections. You can also trade cards from your binder with other
players, in exchange for money, friendship, or other cards.
Store Board
Aftermarket Board
Your Personal Area
Card Fusion
The Millennium Blades Player Rewards Program allows you to recycle your
old, useless cards into shiny new promotional cards.
Card Fusion is costly to use (5 cards for Bronze, 7 for Silver, and 9 for
Gold), and the cards you spend on it cannot be recovered later. The advantage
of exceptionally powerful promotional cards is difficult to ignore, so try it
out! Like Master Grade Cards, Promo Cards work best when you build your
deck around them, so one or two is enough.

Singles are the key cards that make up your
deck. They are the power cards that make
everything work.
Singles vary in power and usefulness. Lower
power, more universal singles are found in the
Core Set, while very powerful and hard-to-use
singles are found the Master Sets.
Deck Boxes represent the engine of
your deck, and help to unify the theme and
capabilities of your deck.
One Deck Box can be included with your
deck. Usually this will give you a secondary
scoring option, which forms a foundation for
the cards you choose to include. If you don't
know where to start, look at the Deck Boxes
available to you and try to find cards that will
make one of them work exceptionally well.
Deck Boxes come in the core set, but
more powerful ones are generally found in
Expansions, Premium, and Master Sets!
Accessories are items that you can use to
protect or enhance your deck. Most accessories
are found in the Core Set, but several other
sets contain them as well.
1. Card Name - The name of the card.
2. Star Rating - Star Ratings range from
1-10, but usually just 1-8. They are used in
collecting and dueling.
3. Set - The logo of the set the card comes
from.
4. Element - There are 6 Elements, usually
used in triggering effects and building sets.*
5. Type - There are 6 Types, usually used in
triggering effects and building sets.*
6. Rarity - The rarity level of the card.
7. Effect Text - The effect of the card.
8. Flavor Text - Some cards have flavor text
in italics. This has no effect on gameplay.

Fire
Air
Light
Water
Earth
Dark
Types
Animal
Myth

Bronze Promo*

* "Promo" refers to any rarity of Promo card.
* Accessories and Deck Boxes do not often
have Elements (4) or Types (5). Those that do
not have one of these symbols cannot be used as
part of a collection.
Some cards have multiple Types or Elements.

DECKBUILDING PHASE:
The Deckbuilding Phase is a real-time phase.
This means that once the phase begins, players
can take any actions they want, as much or as
little as they want, until time runs out.
Setup the Phase
1. All players should flip their player boards
to the Deckbuilding Side, and combine all
their cards together into the Binder Area.
2. Give each player 30 Millennium Dollars
of income.
3. Deal each player 6 cards from the top
of the Store Deck (without paying for them).
These are added to the players' binders facedown,
and cannot be looked at until time
starts.
4. Place the top 9 cards of the store facedown
into the Store Area, so there are 10 cards
showing (including the one on top of the Store)
5. Make sure each player has all of their Sell
Markers.
6. Discard any revealed Metagame cards
out of play. Reveal a new Elemental Metagame
Card.
7. Set a Timer for 7 minutes, and begin!
Build your Deck
The Deck Area can contain up to eight
singles, up to one Deck Box, and up to two
Accessories.
During a Tournament, you will typically
only play 6 cards, so use the extra two slots to
put in backup cards in case you need to change
strategy mid-tournament
You can take cards out of your deck to make
room for new ones just as easily by returning
them to your binder.
You may only have one copy of any card in
your deck!
Pro Tip: Stacking your deck's cards in the
order you plan to play them can save you a lot
of time in the tournament step!
Make your Collection
Your Collection is made up of 2-8 cards,
each having at least one matching symbol with
all the others, and each having a different star
rating than all the others.
At the end of the round, your Collection
will be returned to the box and you will be
awarded points.
You can only build one collection per
Deckbuilding Phase. Don't miss out on this
important opportunity to score victory points!
Your Personal Area
A collection of Dark Cards. The card on the
right could not be part of this collection, because
it doesn't match the element of the collection.
A collection of Soldier Cards. The card on
the right could not be part of this collection,
because it already has a 4-STAR card.
You can freely move cards around in your
personal area in order to sort them for use in
your Deck or Collection, or to be saved for
later in your binder. You can move cards as
often as you want, and separate them in any
ways you like.
The only thing that is important is that at
the end of the timer, you know which cards are
in your deck for the tournament, which are in
your collection, to be returned to the box for
points, and which cards are in your binder, to
be saved for later use.
DECKBUILDING ACTIONS:
While the timer runs, players may begin
taking any of the following actions, as quickly
and as often as they wish:
1. Build your Deck.
2. Make a Collection.
3. Buy a Pack from the Store.
4. Fuse cards from your hand to obtain a
Promo.
5. Sell a card to the Aftermarket.
6. Buy a card from the Aftermarket.
7. Trade with other players.
Setting your Priorities
There are a lot of things to do in the limited
Deckbuilding Time. Here's a list of things in the
order they will score you Victory Points, so you
can prioritize your time.
Build Your Deck - Winning Tournaments
provides more Victory Points than any other
source.
Make Your Collection - Collections provide
a significant number of points, and you can turn
in one per Deckbuilding Phase.
Help Friends - Friendship Points are valuable,
and you can earn them by helping friends.
Amass Wealth - Millennium Dollars are
worth 1 VP per 4 dollars at the end of the
game. Try to sell cards that other players will buy
to keep your personal wealth increasing.
Discards
During tournaments, discarded cards go
to your binder, and you still own them.
Cards that are discarded "to the Store
Discard" may reappear later on during the
game.
Cards that are discarded "to the Box" or
"removed from the game" are placed back
into the game box and will never come back
into play.9
Buy a Pack from the Store
Experience the thrill of blind packs! Buy new
cards without knowing what you're going to get!
Pay Millennium Dollars equal to the buy
cost (the number in its top right) of any facedown
card you want (including the top of the
Store) to the bank, then take that card from
the store area and place it in the binder area of
your board.
Replenish the store area by dealing a card
from the top of the Store into the center of the
table face-down. If the Store runs out of cards,
shuffle the store discard together to form a
new deck.
Card Fusion
Convert unwanted junk cards into powerful
promotional cards.
Choose to do a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Card
Fusion. Select the appropriate number of
cards from your binder (5-Bronze, 7-Silver, or
9-Gold) and place them in the box. Then take
a card from the appropriate pile in the Card
Fusion Area. Place one of your Sell Markers
on the pile.
You cannot perform more than one Card
Fusion of each type per round, and you cannot
perform Card Fusions if you have no Sell
Markers left.
The Store
Sell to the Aftermarket
Place any card from your binder and one of
your Sell Markers into a slot in the Aftermarket.
Then take Millennium Dollars equal to
that card's Star Rating from the bank. The
Aftermarket has no card limit in this phase.
If you have no Sell Markers (because they
are already in the Aftermarket or were used for
Card Fusion), you cannot sell more cards.
The Aftermarket stops accepting cards
for sale in the final 6-minutes before the
tournament. This is to ensure that everyone
has adequate time to buy cards.
Once your card is on sale in the Aftermarket,
you cannot buy it back or remove it from sale!
Buy from the Aftermarket
Choose a card from the Aftermarket with
another players' Sell Marker on it and pay
Millennium Dollars equal to that card's Star
Rating into the bank. Return the Sell Marker
on the card to its owner.
Add your new card to your binder.
The Aftermarket
Trade with Players
You can always Trade with other players
directly, without using the Aftermarket.
However, any trades made between players
must be equal value trades. That is, the total
of all Star Ratings and Millennium Dollars
must be equal on both sides of the trade.
If you are making a trade that clearly benefits
one side more than the other, you may wish to
ask the other side for Friendship in addition
to the other trade items.
Friendship Cards are worth extra Victory
Points at the end of the game. You can't score
them yourself, but you can give them to
another player who helps you out with a good
trade or a rare card. You may not score more
than 6 VP from a single player's Friendship
Cards.
Your Friends
The 5 Fusion Cards are returned to the
box and a Bronze Promo Card is acquired
from the top of its Promo Deck.
Deques really needs Cardine's
promotional Soul Caliper card for
a combo in his deck, but they both
know it's more valuable than an even
trade. Since agreeing to make this
trade is really a favor from Cardine
to Deques, Deques offers a Friendship
Card in addition to the even trade.
If Fulton wants Morrey's Evil Helbane
card, he's got to match its value with
money and cards of his own.

Selling James Bomb to the Aftermarket would
get you seven dollars right away from the
bank. Anyone who wants to buy him later
would pay that same amount into the bank.
Fulton decides to buy a 5-cost Clockwork Empire
card. He pays 5 Millennium Dollars to the
bank, then adds the card to his Binder. Now
he can flip it over and find out what it is!

WHEN TIME RUNS OUT:
After the first 7-minute timer expires, deal each player 6 more cards from the store deck, then reveal the top card of the Type Meta stack.
Set another 7-minute timer. After this timer expires, the Aftermarket stops accepting newcards for sale
(players may still buy cards, but they cannot sell them anymore), and setanother 6-minute timer.
After the final 6-minute timer expires, the Deckbuilding Phase ends, and the tournament begins.
The whole thing looks sort of like this...
Get new cards and cash!

Timers in Millennium Blades are relaxed.
If you see a player scrambling to finish
something they started, all players can agree
to offer a short grace period by starting a new
3-minute timer.
If a player has not even started on an
endeavor (ex: "Oh man, I totally forgot to make
a collection!") it's probably best to just move on
to ending the phase.
End of Deckbuilding
When the final 6-minute timer sounds, the
round ends. Follow these steps to clean up and
get ready for the tournament...
1. In any order, players should each turn in a
maximum of one collection for Victory Points.
2. All loose cards that are not part of a
player's deck are moved to their owners'
binders.
3. Put all cards from the store and the
Aftermarket into the Store Discard Pile.
Scoring Collections
When a collection is scored, place it in the
box and award Victory Points based on the
size of the collection.

"This card press is the anvil upon
which we will forge the blades
for a new generation of heroes!"
- Shamans of the Midwest CEO

"What do I play? Ha! I don't play
card games. I play markets. Stocks.
Commodities. Where you may see an
9-Star Exaltius the Untenable, I see a
emergent market, ripe for speculation."
- Fulton Suitcase, in an interview for
Top Tier, Top Dollar Magazine

PERSONAL SPACE & ETIQUETTE:
You should never touch cards on
another player's player board.
When a player reveals a new card from
the Store, that player has the first chance
to buy that card, if he or she wishes.
If two players both want to buy the same card
from the Store or Aftermarket, give priority
to the player with fewer Victory Points.
It's fine to stop the timer for a moment,
if a player asks for a rules explanation
or needs something clarified.

"A card game is a form of personal
expression. You take what you
believe about the worldeverything
you want to say and everything you
want to proveand you build it into
a deck, and then you put your world
view into direct competition with your
opponent. And at the end of the game,
you know exactly who is right."
- Deques Applenti

TOURNAMENT PHASE:
The Tournament Phase is a turn-based
phase. Players will take turns in clockwise
order around the table, each making a single
turn. The tournament ends when no players
are able to take any more turns.
Setup the Phase
1. All players should flip their player boards
to the Tournament Side. They should set their
binder cards off to the side of the play area, and
take the cards in their decks into their hands.
2. Each player should set their current
RP to zero.
3. Each player should set out their
Accessories and Deck Box onto the allotted
spaces on the tournament board. All Singles
remain in your hand.
4. Turns begin with whichever player
placed highest in the previous tournament (or
whoever most recently opened a booster pack in
real life, in case of a tie or the first game round)
and proceeds clockwise.
Ranking Points
Most cards give you Ranking Points (RP) or
disrupt your opponents as they try to score RP.
At the end of the tournament, your placement
is determined by your total RP.
Top Card
The right-most face-up card on a player's
play area is called the Top Card. This card is
used for clashes (explained on the next page),
and also activates its Top effects.
If there are face-down cards on the right
edge of your tableau, your Top Card is the
face-up card closest to the right edge.
Deck Box Area
There is a slot reserved on the Tournament Board for your Deck Box. It
starts face-up in play. A card cannot affect or target your Deck Box unless it
specifically says it can.
Tableau
Singles you play during the tournament will be placed into these slots,
called the Tableau. Always place singles in the left-most available slot in this
area.
Accessories
There are two slots reserved for your accessories on the Tournament
Board. Both of your Accessories start face-up in play. A card cannot affect or
target your Accessories unless it specifically says it can.
Your Tournament Area

TOURNAMENT TURNS:
On a player's turn, he or she may take one
Action and must play one Single, in either
order. If the player is unable to play a Single,
they cannot take an Action, and instead Passes.
A player will be unable to play a single if he
or she has no cards in hand, or if his or her
entire tableau is filled already. Once all players
pass in succession, the tournament ends.
Use an Action (Optional)
Actions usually show up on Accessories, but
any card might have one. Actions are always
denoted by the "Action:" keyword. To use an
action, perform the text on the card, then flip
the card face-down. You can use one action
per turn, either before or after playing a Single.
Play a Single (Required)
On your turn, you must play a Single if you
are able. Place the Single face-up in the next
open left-most slot of your singles area.
Because her right-most card has been flipped
down, El Vice is now Shur's Top Card. If all her
cards are face-down, she has no Top Card.
The Ranking Points Track
simulates your performance over
a multi-round tournament.
Illegal Decks
It's possible that players may accidentally
bring more cards than they are allowed
to the tournament. Randomly remove
cards from the player's deck to their binder
until it is below the 8-card limit.
Face-Down Cards
Face Down cards have no STAR RATING,
ELEMENT, or TYPE. They still count as cards
(ex: gain 5 for each card to the left of this
one), but do not have any text or attributes.

CLASHING:
Many cards in the game will instruct you to
clash with an opponent, or with all players. If
clashing with another player, choose a player
with a Top Card. In a multi-player Clash, each
player who has a Top Card is able to participate
in the Clash.
Each player in the clash reveals the top card
of the Store (starting with whoever initiated
the clash and moving clockwise) add the Star
Rating of the card revealed in the clash and
the Star Rating of your Top Card. If one player
has a higher total than any other player, that
player is the winner, and all other players are
the losers. If there is a tie for the highest total,
then the clash is a tie.
Put all cards revealed this way into the
Aftermarket. If there is no space left (max.
12), discard all cards in the Aftermarket to the
Store Discard before adding any new cards.
In a tie, neither player wins nor loses. If a
clash does not have at least two participants
(due to not having Top Cards), then the clash
does not occur.
General Rules
A few effects show up frequently on cards.
These are explained here.
Discard a Card - The card is discarded to
the owner's Binder (unless another location is
specified). Cards discarded to the binder are
unavailable for the rest of the tournament.
Reveal a Card from your hand - The card
is shown from your hand to all players, then
returned to your hand.
Reveal a Face-down card - The card is
picked up and shown to all players, then placed
face-down again in the same slot.
Flip a Card - Flipped cards are turned facedown.
While a card is face-down, it has no
attributes (Star Rating, Rarity, Element, Type,
Set, etc), and is considered a blank card for all
purposes. "Flip a Card" does not allow you to
flip cards face-up, and you must choose a faceup
card to flip down when selecting a target
for these effects.
In general, effects cannot target face-down
cards, unless they specifically say otherwise.
Cannot be flipped - If you have cards that
are protected from flipping, you cannot choose
one of those cards when an opponent forces
you to choose and flip one of your cards.
Example: Shur must "flip her highest card".
Since her highest card is protected by Orella
(adjacent cards cannot be flipped by opponents'
effects), there are no legal targets for the effect,
and she can ignore it.
If she were instructed to "flip a card of her
choice", she would have to choose Orella, since
the other two cards cannot be flipped and are
thus not legal choices.
Example: Deques uses his Salamander,
Volcanic Lizard (flipping it down) to trigger a
clash with Cardine, using his Top Card: Knight
Captain Malcombe (10). Her Top Card is Evil
Beethoven (8). Deques reveals the top card
of the Store and it's a 3. Cardine reveals a 6.
Deques' total is 13 and Cardine's is 14, so she
wins the clash.
They put both of the cards revealed in the
clash into the Aftermarket Area, to be available
for sale during the next round.
Effects on Cards
Each kind of card may have different effects.
These effects fall into a few broad categories,
and follow the same notation as Actions, but
with different timing words on them.
Play - Play effects are activated right away
when a card comes into play. Perform the Play
Effect on the card when you play it from your
hand. Cards with Play effects are considered
"in play" for the purposes of effects when their
effect is resolving.
Next - Next effects trigger on the next card
you play, no matter whose turn it is or what
slot in your tableau you play it to.
Flip - Flip effects are activated when a card
is flipped face-down.
Ongoing - Ongoing effects keep on working
continuously as long as the card is face-up in
your tableau.
Top - Top effects work as long as the card
with the Top effect is the right-most face-up
card in your tableau. If other cards get flipped
down or if you can rearrange cards, you can
keep your best Top effects for multiple rounds.
Top Effects can also affect your opponents
quite often, and are good for disruption.
Score - Score effects are activated during
the end of the tournament, and usually let you
score additional Ranking Points. Activate all
of the Score effects (of face-up cards) in your
tableau (going left to right), then your Deck
Boxes, then Accessories, then the Metagames.
Since Score effects primarily just earn you
points, activation order rarely matters.
Reaction - Reaction effects are activated
whenever the relevant condition on the effect
is met. When you activate a Reaction, the
card that triggers it is flipped face-down. You
always have the option of not using your own
Reaction Effects, just like with Actions.
Besides Reactions, other Effects are Not
Optional, and must be used at the correct time.
Top>Ongoing>Play>Next>Score is the
order of what effects take priority over other
effects. The player whose turn it is gets the first
opportunity to use Flip or Reaction effects, with
that opportunity passing clockwise.

ENDING THE TOURNAMENT:
The tournament ends when all players are
unable to take further turns.
1. Each player should activate all Score
effects of face-up cards, starting with Singles
in your tableau, then the Deck Box, then
Accessories, and finally the Metagame Cards.
Every Player activates the Metagame Score
effects for themselves.
2. Award VP for each player based
on the Tournament VP chart for your
current round (regardless of your total
number of players). Players place in the
tournament according to the number of
Ranking Points (RP) they've accumulated.
If two or more players tie, add up and divide
between them the VP for all places they
would win. (Example: in a 3-way tie for second,
add up and divide evenly the points for second,
third, and fourth place, rounded down). Keep
track of VP on the score sheet.
3. Reveal a complete set of Promo Cards,
based on the Prize Support column of the
Tournament VP Chart. Players get one of
these randomly.
4. If this is the first or second round, place
all cards into their owners' binders, then flip
over all play mats to return to the Deckbuilding
Side. Return all players' Sell Markers to them.
5. If it is round three, proceed to final
scoring.
Round 1st Place 2nd Place 3rd Place 4th Place 5th Place Prize Support
Pre-Release 7 5 4 3 2 None
Round 1 21 15 12 9 6 Bronze
Round 2 28 20 16 12 8 Silver
Final Round 42 30 24 18 12 None (Game End)
Game End
When the game ends, players should total
up all of their Victory Points ( VP) and
see who is the Ultimate Millennium Blades
Champion.
Total up these points:
1. Tournament VPs for each round.
2. Collection VPs for each round.
3. Remaining Money VPs, at a rate of
4 Millennium Dollars to 1 VP, rounding
down.
4. Friendship Card VPs collected from
other players.
The player who has the most VP is declared
the winner!
In case of a tie, the winner is whoever had
the most VP from tournaments. If the game
is still a tie, then whoever had the most VP
from Collections, followed by Money and then
Friendship breaking ties in that order.
Set Specific Keywords
Many sets use special Keywords to describe
their effects. When you see a keyword, its
effects are always the same. On most cards, the
keyword's full text is printed out.
Mimicry - A card with Mimicry has the
Element and Type symbols of a face-up card to
its immediate left instead of its own. This effect
ends if the card to its left is flipped. This effect
continues to work during scoring.
Blast Off - Action: You may flip this card to
put 3 +1 STAR tokens on the next card you
play. +1 STAR tokens increase a card's Star
Rating by 1 each. Blast Off also has a PLUS
variation that adds even more +1 STAR
tokens!
Scurry - Play: You may insert this card
anywhere into your tableau. When you do
this, you will shift some of your cards to the
right to make room.
Anvil Drop - Action: Flip a card in another
player's tableau with a lower than this card.
Thwomp! - Play: If the card to the left has a
lower than this one, flip it and gain .
Tournament VP Chart
Infinite Loops
Infinite Loops are very rare, but theoretically
possible. If you manage to cause an Infinite
Loop (a set of mandatory effects that cannot
be stopped), you are immediately removed
from the tournament, but you score
VP as though you had won first place (this
doesn't prevent another player from actually
winning first place through normal means).
After this, all your tournament cards (hand,
tableau, box, and accessories) are returned
to the box, and you gain Millennium Dollars
equal to their total sell value. You do not gain
Millennium Dollars if it is the last round.
"Shouting your card names
triumphantly as you slam them down
into your tableau makes them even
more powerful and intimidating."
Aftermarket Space
Remember that the Aftermarket works
differently depending on the phase. During
Deckbuilding there is no limit to the
number of cards that can be in it. During
Tournaments, the Aftermarket has a limit
of 12 cards. If a card or cards would be
placed in the Aftermarket and cause it to
go over this limit, discard all cards in the
Aftermarket to the store discard, then place
the new card or cards in the Aftermarket.

VARIANTS & OPTIONS:
Want more Millennium Blades? This
section gives players who are experienced
with the game a ton of new ways to change the
experience and replay Millennium Blades!
Turn-Based Mode
You can play Millennium Blades as a turnbased
game as well by following these rules.
In turn based mode, there is only one phase,
which is a combination of both tournament
and deckbuilding phases. This mode can be
played by 2-5 players. Friendship is not used
in this mode.
1. Setup the store deck as usual.
2. Determine who will be first player, and
deal each player 7 cards. Each player gains
30 Millennium Dollars, and has a maximum
one immediately from the same pile.
6. Draw a new hand of 6 cards, gain 30 more
Millennium Dollars, and retrieve any used Sell
Markers.
7. If this is your first time scoring, gain a
random silver promo from out of play. If this is
your second time scoring, gain a random Gold
Promo instead.
Now you're able to start working on your
second deck. After a player scores for the third
time, he is out of the game.
After all players have scored three times,
total up their RP across all three rounds.
This total score is your score for the game.
The highest total RP wins!
Duel Mode
Duel mode is a 2 player variant for
Millennium Blades. It is played over 3 rounds.
The winner is determined by who wins best 2
out of 3 tournaments.
Mode Differences:
All rules and actions in this mode are the
same as in normal rules, unless otherwise
stated.
Friendship is not used in this mode.
Each player may form two collections
during the Deckbuilding Phase: one Elemental
collection and one Type collection. Instead of
gaining VP from them, these are converted
to RP and are added to your total RP at
the end of the Tournament Phase at a rate of
10 RP per card.
Additionally, each player has 6 Sell Markers
to use in this mode (use two different kinds of
Sell Markers for this). Trading is available to
players, but trades must still be even.
The first player to win two tournaments is
declared the winner of the game!
hand size of 7 cards.
3. Reveal both metas at the game start.
4. Choose two Bronze Promo Sets and one
Silver Promo Set to be fusable during the game.
Gold Promos are not fusable in this mode.
5. Choose one Silver Promo Set and one
Gold Promo Set to be given out during scoring
and set these aside.
On a player's turn, he must perform exactly
one of these actions:
1. Buy a card from the store or from the
Aftermarket (he must have fewer than 7 cards
to do this).
2. Sell a card to the Aftermarket (if he has
sell markers remaining).
3. Fuse cards from his hand into a promo
using normal card fusion rules. Since your
hand size is 7, Gold Promos are not available
to fuse in this mode.
4. Add a card from his hand to a collection.
The collection's type/element is declared at the
moment you add the first card to it. You may
have two collections at a timeone based on
element, and another based on type.
5. Play a card from his hand into his tableau,
or as a deck box or accessory, following all
rules as in a tournament.
6. Score his tableau and collection.
As in a normal game, players can use
"Action:" effects before or after doing their main
action for the turn.
Scoring is the only new action available to
players in this mode. To Score, follow these
steps:
1. Activate all Score effects on cards in your
tableau, in the meta, and on your Accessories
and Deck Box.
2. Gain 10 RP for each card in your
collections.
3. Record your final RP on a score sheet
or other device, then reduce your RP back
to zero.
4. Discard your tableau, deck box, hand and
collection to the store discard. You may choose
to discard or keep your accessories.
5. Choose and place one of the Metas onto
the bottom of the deck. Replace it with a new
Character Powers
There are six main characters in Millennium
Blades, and you can take on their personas to
specialize your play style.
To use characters, just bring in the relevant
character cards. Each card has two sides, a
Deckbuilding side and a Tournament side,
giving you new powers during each phase.
Familiarize yourself with both sides before
the game begins, and show the relevant side
during each phase.

Pro Player Cards
When playing with characters, you can
introduce Pro Player Cards. Pro Player cards
have their own Type.
During rounds 1 and 2, when a player scores
first place in the tournament, give each player
(including himself) a copy of his Pro Player
Card.
If a player who won the first tournament
also wins the second one, give the 2nd place
player's Pro Player card to all players instead.
Venues
There's no need to play in the same game
store every week! Why not go to the museum,
or play on the edge of an active volcano?
Shuffle together the Venue Deck and place
it beside the Metagames. When you start the
Deckbuilding Round, also reveal the top card
of the Venue Deck. It will have rules to follow
for the Deckbuilding Phase, Tournament Phase
or both. Discard it when the tournament ends.
Millennium Accessories
The Millennium Accessories are the world's
most powerful accessories, wreathed in legend.
If you are playing with a less-experienced
player, you can give that player a random
Millennium Accessory as a handicap.
Alternatively, if all players are equally
experienced, and want to raise the power curve
of the game, they can draft the Millennium
Accessories at the game start.
Draft Mode
Draft Mode is an optional rule for advanced
players who want more control over the cards
they receive each round.
Draft Mode replaces the random cards at the
start of the Deckbuilding Phase (Deckbuilding
Setup, Step 3).
When Deckbuilding begins, deal each
player 6 cards from the Store. Players then
draft these cards, going clockwise until each
player has claimed six cards (take one card
from your set of 6, then pass the rest to the
player on your left).
After the first 7-minute timer ends, repeat
this process, this time passing cards counterclockwise.
Liquidation Mode
Liquidation Mode is an optional rule for
advanced players who want to see a lot more
variety in decks.
During set up, put 2 additional Expansion,
Premium, and Master sets into your store
deck. At the end of each tournament round
except the last, players return all the cards in
their decks to the box (including deck boxes
and accessories), and receive Millennium
Dollars equal to the combined Star Ratings of
all the cards liquidated in this way.
When playing in Liquidation Mode, money
only provides half as many VPs (1 VP
per 8 Millennium Dollars).
Free Market Mode
Free Market Mode is an optional rule for
advanced players who are very confident in
their card evaluation abilities.
With Free Market Mode, players may make
uneven trades. That is, both sides of a trade do
not need to match up in terms of Millennium
Dollars and Star Ratings.
Though it seems like a simple change,
this mode gives veteran players a massive
advantage over less experienced players, so be
careful when using this optional rule.
"When I build a new deck, it's
like writing a new song. I have
all these different pieces that are
meaningless on their own, but then
you arrange them together and
add a big idea, and you've created
something unique and awesome.

for Pure Deck Designer Magazine

Deques Applenti
USA, 19, Musician (Drummer)
Specialty: Deckbuilding
Why he plays: For expression
Cardine Kolleckta

Specialty: Collecting
Why she plays: For discovery
Fulton Suitcase
Norway, 37, Investment Banker
Specialty: Buying
Why he plays: For profit
Character Intros
Deques is the drummer for an American
Indie Band, Heart of the Decks, who creates
epic music to duel by during tournaments.
He's well-known in the Millennium Blades
scene for his unique and often bizarre
deck concepts which have swept aside the
tournament meta and turned the game on its
head more than once. When he's not touring
with his bandmates you can usually find
Deques at his apartment on a Friday Night,
hosting a draft tournament party with about
twenty friends from the local store scene.
Deques specializes in building unique
concept decks. He can include extra deck
boxes and accessories in his tournament kit,
giving him additional scoring and defense
options during the game. These options
allow him to safely play decks which would
normally be very vulnerable to disruption,
and to score them in multiple ways. His
ability to play decks that would be impossible
for other characters to pull off makes him an
especially interesting character.
An art student in Russia, Cardine has
achieved fame among the international
Millennium Blades community for her
custom-painted cards and for sculpture
integrating cards. Her work has been featured
on a number of promotional cards in the
game, and she is always on the lookout for
rare gems scrounged from attics, thrift shops,
and estate sales.
Cardine is a balanced character who starts
the game with extra advantages in the form of
some rare promo cards and who can acquire
rare cards from card fusion more easily
than other players. These rare cards form a
strong core to Cardine's deck, giving her an
advantage over slower players in the early
rounds of the game. During tournaments,
she can re-score some of her cards, doubling
down on the most effective plays in her
arsenal.
An investment banker by trade, Fulton has
recently taken to speculating on the futures of
cards in the Millennium Blades Aftermarket.
His considerable personal wealth allows him
to buy and sell large quantities of identical
singles, effectively controlling the price
of specific cards. Fulton enjoys the game
itself, but he plays primarily to understand
the value of the cards and to inform his
investments. Getting close to the action by
playing in the pro tour gives him an edge
against other investors when speculating on
what next season's chase cards will be.
Fulton's abilities primarily shine during
the deckbuilding phase, where he receives
extra money and is able to peek at store cards
before buying them. This helps him maximize
the returns on what he purchases from the
store and create a better deck more quickly
than other players. During gameplay, he
can use leftover money to boost the value of
his cards, giving him an edge in clashes and
during scoring.

Character Intros
Hailing from France, Morrey is the
founder and owner of Revanche ("Rematch"
in America and the UK), the world's largest
store chain dealing in tabletop games and
accessories. Though his success in business
lets him live the high society life of the rich
and famous, he still keeps up with the games
he sells and can be found regularly in his
own stores playing casually. While he doesn't
compete in his own stores' tournaments, he
often sponsors pro teams or plays in the pro
tour himself to promote Revanche.
Morrey specializes in controlling the
Aftermarket during deckbuilding, with the
ability to buy cards more cheaply and sell
them at a higher price than the other players.
The extra cash this generates gives him an
edge when making deals to get the cards he
needs for his deck. During tournaments,
Morrey can use cards from the store deck to
boost his own deck, and can manipulate the
store deck to gain an edge when clashing with
opponents.
In the world of Millennium Blades,
Portugal is one of the world's major
technology centers. Scientists at the
Universidade de Tecnologias Ludicas
developed the Power Creep project to apply
high-level artificial intelligence to collectible
card games. Players all around the world
can deck-test against Power Creep online
via the cloud. The data that is collected from
this testing is distilled down into a central
database, which is brought to tournaments
to compete against the most skilled human
opponents.
Due to the vast reach of the deck-testing
cloud platform, Power Creep has the ability
to control the Metagame, manipulating what
types and elements will perform best in
upcoming tournaments. By playing heavily
to the current metagame, Power Creep can
score massive points, though this can make
his decks easier to disrupt for players who are
playing specifically to counter the meta.
Shur is the Chinese national champion
of Millennium Blades, and a celebrity in
her own right. In addition to numerous
commercial and fashion magazine
appearances, she's a well-known cosplayer
and pro-tour circuit player who has her sights
set on becoming the World Champion of
Millennium Blades. Shur plays to win, and
is a cutthroat duelist who doesn't pull any
punches. Her confrontational personality
makes her satisfying to win as and against.
Shur's deck-building ability is somewhat
weak, and she focuses heavily on the
tournament phase, where her ability to win
duels gives her an edge on other players.
She gets to play extra cards into her tableau,
meaning that she can build more powerful
combo decks than any other character,
and can delay playing her power cards or
disruption cards until others have already
dropped out of the running.

FAQ:
Level 99 Games
Q: What Star Value do face-down cards have?
A: Face-down cards have no Star Value and cannot
gain Tokens or through any means.
Q: Can a copy effect (Like Yellow Egg's) be copied?
Can a copy effect copy a face down card?
A: Copy effects can never be copied. The card in
question will usually indicate this. A copy effect that
would target a face-down card does nothing, and the card
remains in its original state.
Q: If I am required to flip a card of my choice, can
I choose a card that cannot be flipped?
A: No, a card that cannot be flipped is not a legal
target for a flip effect.
Q: If a card makes me lose RP and I don't have
enough to lose, what happens?
A: You lose as much as you can and stop at zero.
Effects that trigger based on losing a specific amount of
RP still happen even if no RP is lost.
Q: If I gain an extra slot in my tableau, where is it?
A: Any extra tableau slots are always at the rightmost
side of your tableau unless otherwise stated on the card.
Q: What happens if the Store runs out of cards?
A: Shuffle the Store Discard to form a new Store Deck.
Any promo cards that come up in the store can be bought
for cash instead of via fusion.
Q: What happens if the Aftermarket spaces are
filled during the Deckbuilding Phase?
A: The Aftermarket has no space limit during the
Deckbuilding Phase, only during the Tournament Phase.
Q: How do I tell how many of a card are in a set?
A: The highest star card in the set has one copy while
the lowest has three. Any other card in the set has two
copies. In promo sets, there is one copy of every card. Core
Set is an exception to the above rules.
Q: What happens if I have multiple reaction effects
trigger at the same time?
A: You resolve all reaction effects you control in any
order you wish. If an opponent has an effect that triggers
at the same time yours does, the player whose turn it is
has priority, followed by the other players with effects in
turn order.
Q: How do attached cards function?
A: Attached cards are not considered in the tableau for
effects. If a card that has an attachment becomes flipped,
the attached card is put back in your binder.
Q: Do Tokens count for Token effects?
A: Yes. A Token is the same as three Tokens.

GAME NAME:
Pandemic

DESIGNED BY:
Matt Leacock
Do you have what it takes to save humanity? As skilled members of a disease-fighting team, you must keep
four deadly diseases at bay while discovering their cures.
You and your teammates will travel across the globe, treating infections while finding resources for cures.
You must work together, using your individual strengths, to succeed. The clock is ticking as outbreaks and
epidemics fuel the spreading plagues.
Can you find all four cures in time? The fate of humanity is in your hands!

COMPONENTS:
- 7 Role cards 59 Player cards
- (48 City cards, 6 Epidemic cards, 5 Event cards)
- 96 Disease cubes
- 24 in 4 colors 4 Cure markers
- 4 Reference cards
- 1 Board
- 1 Infection rate
marker
- 1 Outbreaks marker
- 6 Research stations

OVERVIEW:
In Pandemic, you and your fellow players are members of a disease control team. You must work together to develop cures
and prevent disease outbreaks, before 4 deadly diseases (Blue, Yellow, Black, and Red) contaminate humanity.
Pandemic is a cooperative game. The players all win or lose together.
The goal is to discover cures for all 4 diseases. The players lose if:
8 outbreaks occur (a worldwide panic happens),
not enough disease cubes are left when needed (a disease spreads too much), or,
not enough player cards are left when needed (your team runs out of time).
Each player has a specific role with special abilities to improve the team's chances.

To see a Pandemic teaching video, go to:
www.zmangames.com/pandemic-online-rules.html

SETUP:
Set out the board and pieces
Place outbreaks
and cure markers
Give each player cards and a pawn
Disease cubes
Give each player a reference card. Shuffle the Role cards and
deal 1 face up in front of each player. Place the matching
colored pawns for these roles in Atlanta. Remove from the
game the remaining Role cards and pawns.
Take the Epidemic cards out the Player Deck and set them
aside until Step 5. Shuffle the other Player cards (City and
Event cards). Deal cards to the players to form their initial
hands. Give cards according to the number of players:
Place the outbreaks marker on the "0" space of the
Outbreaks Track. Place the 4 cure markers, "vial" side up,
near the Discovered Cure Indicators.
Place the board within easy reach of all players. Put the 6 research
stations and disease cubes nearby. Separate the cubes by color into
4 supply piles. Place 1 research station in Atlanta.
Atlanta is home to the CDC, the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention.
Place infection rate marker
and infect 9 cities
Set the game's difficulty level, by using either 4, 5, or 6 Epidemic cards, for
an Introductory, Standard, or Heroic game. Remove any unused Epidemic
cards from the game.
Divide the remaining player cards into face down piles, as equal in size as
you can, so that the number of piles matches the number of Epidemic cards
you are using. Shuffle 1 Epidemic card into each pile, face down. Stack these
piles to form the Player Deck, placing smaller piles on the bottom.
Begin play
The players look at the City cards they have in their hand.
The player with the highest City population goes first.

PLAY:
Each player turn is divided into 3 parts:
1. Do 4 actions.
2. Draw 2 Player cards.
3. Infect cities.
After a player is done infecting cities, the player on
their left goes next.
Players should freely give each other advice. Let
everyone offer opinions and ideas. However, the player
whose turn it is decides what to do.
Your hand can have City and Event cards in it.
City cards are used in some actions and Event cards
can be played at any time.
Place the infection rate marker on the left-most "2" space of the
Infection Rate Track. Shuffle the Infection cards and flip over 3 of them.
Put 3 disease cubes of the matching color on each of these cities.
Flip over 3 more cards: put 2 disease cubes on each of these cities.
Flip over 3 more cards: put 1 disease cube on each of these cities.
(You will place a total of 18 disease cubes, each matching the color of
the city.) Place these 9 cards face up on the Infection Discard Pile.
The other Infection cards form the Infection Deck.
Use disease cubes matching the card colors.

3.Infect cities
A white line that goes off the board "wraps around"
to the other edge and connects to a city.
Example: Sydney and Los Angeles are connected.

ACTIONS:
You may do up to 4 actions each turn.
Select any combination of the actions listed below. You may do the same action
several times, each time counting as 1 action. Your role's special abilities may change
how an action is done. Some actions involve discarding a card from your hand; all these
discards go to the Player Discard Pile.

MOVEMENT ACTIONS:
Drive / Ferry
Move to a city connected by a white line to the one you are in.
Direct Flight
Discard a City card to move to the city named on the card.
Charter Flight
Discard the City card that matches the city you are in to move to any city.
Shuttle Flight
Move from a city with a research station to any other city that has a
research station.

OTHER ACTIONS:
Build a Research Station
Discard the City card that matches the city you are in to place a research
station there. Take the research station from the pile next to the board. If all
6 research stations have been built, take a research station from anywhere
on the board.
Treat Disease
Remove 1 disease cube from the city you are in, placing it in the cube
supply next to the board. If this disease color has been cured (see
Discover a Cure below), remove all cubes of that color from the city you
are in.
If the last cube of a cured disease is removed from the board, this disease
is eradicated. Flip its cure marker from its "vial" side to its " " side.
Share Knowledge
You can do this action in two ways:
give the City card that matches the city you are in to another player, or
take the City card that matches the city you are in from another player.
The other player must also be in the city with you. Both of you need to
agree to do this.
If the player who gets the card now has more than 7 cards, that player must
immediately discard a card or play an Event card (see Event Cards on page 7).
Discover a Cure
At any research station, discard 5 City cards of the same color from your
hand to cure the disease of that color. Move the disease's cure marker to its
Cure Indicator.
If no cubes of this color are on the board, this disease is now eradicated.
Flip its cure marker from its "vial" side to its " " side.
If there are cubes from several cured diseases in a
city, you must still Treat Disease once for each cured
color to remove these cubes.
If more than 6 research stations were supplied,
set any extra aside during setup.
Example: If you have the Moscow
City card and are with another player
in Moscow, you can give this card to
that player. Or, if another player has
the Moscow card and you both are in
Moscow, then you can take it from that
player. In either case, you both must
agree before handing the card over.
Eradicating a disease is not needed to win. However,
when cities of an eradicated disease are infected, no
new disease cubes are placed there (see Epidemics
and Infections on page 6). Removing the last cube of
a disease that is not cured has no effect.
When a disease is cured, its cubes remain on the
board and new cubes can still be placed during
epidemics or infections (see Epidemics and
Infections on page 6). However, treating this disease
is now easier and you are closer to winning.

PLAY EXAMPLE:
On the first turn, Ben does 4 actions:
(1) Drive to Chicago (from Atlanta), (2) Drive to San Francisco,
(3) Treat Disease in San Francisco, removing a blue disease cube
there, and (4) Treat Disease in San Francisco again, removing a
second blue disease cube.
Ben has finished the Actions part of his turn.
Play Example: Later in the game, the red disease has been cured.
3 red cubes remain on the board in Manila, where Anna the Scientist
(white pawn) begins her turn. Anna (1) Treats Disease in Manila,
removing all 3 cubes with one action (since this disease has been
cured). This eradicates the red disease, so the red cure marker is
flipped over to its " " side.
George, the Operations Expert (green pawn), is in
Chennai, having built a research station there.
George tells Anna that he has the Chennai City card
in his hand and offers to let Anna take it from him
if she can get to Chennai. Anna discards her Manila
City card for a (2) Charter Flight, moving her pawn
to Chennai.
Anna then (3) Shares Knowledge with George, taking
his Chennai card. Doing this gives Anna 4 black cards,
which is not enough to cure a disease.
However, Anna is the Scientist and needs to discard only 4 cards of
the same color to cure the corresponding disease. Anna (4) Discovers
a Cure, discarding her 4 black cards at the Chennai research station.
The black cure marker is moved to the Black Cure Indicator.
Anna has finished the Actions part of her turn.
1.Do 4 actions
2.Draw 2 cards
Resolve any epidemics
Discard to 7 cards
3. Infect Cities
Flip over as many Infection cards from the top of the Infection Deck as the
current infection rate. This number is below the space of the Infection Rate
Track that has the infection rate marker. Flip these cards over one at a time,
infecting the city named on each card.
To infect a city, place 1 disease cube matching its color onto the city, unless
this disease has been eradicated. If the city already has 3 cubes of this color,
do not place a 4th cube. Instead, an outbreak of this disease occurs in the city
(see Outbreaks below). Discard this card to the Infection Discard Pile.
In this case in the second epidemic's Infection card will be the
only card to "reshuffle", ending on top of the Infection Deck.
An outbreak will then occur in this city during Infections (see
Infections, below), unless an Event card is played to prevent this
(see Event Cards on page 7).
1.Do 4 actions
2.Draw 2 cards
Resolve any epidemics
Discard to
3.Infect cities

PLAY EXAMPLE (cont.):
Anna ends her turn by infecting cities. The current
infection rate is 3, so Anna flips over the top 3 Infection cards: Seoul,
then Paris, then Algiers.
The red disease is eradicated, so Anna simply discards the Seoul card.
Paris has a blue cube on it, so Anna adds a second blue cube there and
discards the Paris card.
The black disease has been cured  but not eradicated (black cubes are
still on the board)  so Anna must infect Algiers. Since 3 black disease
cubes are already in Algiers, Anna does not place a 4th cube there.
Instead, a black disease outbreak happens in Algiers.
DRAW CARDS
After doing 4 actions, draw the top 2 cards together from the Player
Deck.
If, as you are about to draw, there are fewer than 2 cards left
in the Player Deck, the game ends and your team has lost!
(Do not reshuffle the discards to form a new deck.)
EPIDEMIC CARDS:
If your draws include any Epidemic cards, immediately do the following
steps in order:
1. Increase: Move the infection rate marker forward 1 space on the
Infection Rate Track.
2. Infect: Draw the bottom card from the Infection Deck. Unless its
disease color has been eradicated, put 3 disease cubes of that color on
the named city. If the city already has cubes of this color, do not add
3 cubes to it. Instead, add just enough cubes so that it has 3 cubes of
this color and then an outbreak of this disease occurs in the city (see
Outbreaks below). Discard this card to the Infection Discard Pile.
If you cannot place the number of cubes actually needed on
the board, because there are not enough cubes of the needed
color left in the supply, the game ends and your team has
lost! This can occur during an epidemic, an outbreak, or
infections (see Outbreaks and Infections below).
3. Intensify: Reshuffle just the cards in the Infection Discard Pile and
place them on top of the Infection Deck.
When doing these steps, remember to draw from the bottom
of the Infection Deck and to then reshuffle only the Infection
Discard Pile, placing it on top of the existing Infection Deck.
It is rare but possible to draw 2 Epidemic cards at once. In this case, do
all three steps above once and then again.
After resolving any Epidemic cards, remove them from the game.
Do not draw replacement cards for them.
HAND LIMIT:
If you ever have more than 7 cards in hand (after first resolving any
Epidemic cards you may have drawn), discard cards or play Event cards
until you have 7 cards in hand (see Event Cards on page 7).
Play Example (cont.): Anna draws 2
cards. Neither is an Epidemic card and
Anna is well under her 7-card hand limit,
so Anna continues her turn.

OUTBREAKS:
When a disease outbreak occurs, move the outbreaks marker forward
1 space on the Outbreaks Track. Then, place 1 cube of the disease color
on every city connected to the city. If any of them already has 3 cubes of
the disease color, do not place a 4th cube in those cities. Instead, in each of
them, a chain reaction outbreak occurs after the current outbreak is done.
When a chain reaction outbreak occurs, first move the outbreaks marker
forward 1 space. Then, place cubes as above, except do not add a cube to
cities that have already had an outbreak (or a chain reaction outbreak) as
part of resolving the current Infection card.
As a result of outbreaks, a city may have disease cubes of multiple colors on
it; up to 3 cubes of each color.
If the outbreaks marker reaches the last space of the Outbreaks
Track, the game ends and your team has lost!
TURN END:
After infecting cities and discarding Infection cards, your turn is over.
The player on your left begins a turn.
EVENT CARDS:
During a turn, any player may play Event cards. Playing
an Event card is not an action. The player who plays an
Event card decides how it is used.
Event cards can be played at any time, except in between
drawing and resolving a card.
Example: During infections, the first Infection card drawn causes an
outbreak. You may not play the Airlift Event card to move the Quarantine
Specialist to prevent this. After this outbreak happens however, you may
use Airlift to move the Quarantine Specialist (to possibly protect other
cities) before flipping over the next Infection card.
After playing an Event card, discard it to the Player Discard Pile.
PLAYER CARDS:
When playing the Introductory game (4 Epidemic cards), place your
cards face up in front of you, for all players to see.
When playing the Standard (5 Epidemics) or Heroic (6 Epidemics)
games, keep your cards private, so everyone has information to
contribute to play discussions.
Players may freely examine either discard pile at any time.
GAME END
The players win as soon as cures to all 4 diseases are discovered.
There are 3 ways for the game to end and the players to lose:
if the outbreaks marker reaches the last space of the Outbreaks Track,
if you are unable to place the number of disease cubes actually
needed on the board, or
if a player cannot draw 2 Player cards after doing his actions.
When 2 Epidemic cards are drawn together, events can be played
after resolving the first epidemic.
Experienced groups may decide to play with open hands,
if desired, in these games.
Only Player cards count towards your hand limit.
Your Role and your Reference cards are not part of your hand.
The players do not have to eradicate all 4 diseases to win;
just cure them. Once all diseases are cured, the game ends and players
win immediately, no matter how many cubes are on the board.

PLAY EXAMPLE (cont.):
A black disease outbreak
occurs in Algiers. Anna moves the outbreaks
marker forward 1 space and places 1 black cube
on every city connected to Algiers: Madrid, Paris,
Istanbul, and Cairo. Cairo already has 3 black
cubes, so Anna does not place a 4th cube there.
Instead, a chain reaction outbreak occurs in Cairo.
Anna moves the outbreaks marker forward
1 more space. She places 1 black cube on every
city connected to Cairo  Istanbul, Baghdad,
Riyadh, and Khartoum  but not Algiers,
as Algiers has already had an outbreak while
resolving this Infection card. Then, Anna discards
the Algiers Infection card.

Play any time. Not an action.
EVENT
AIRLIFT
Move Any 1 pawn to Any city.
Get perMission before MovinG
Another paAyer's pAwn.

COMMONLY OVERLOOKED RULES:
You do not draw a replacement card after drawing an Epidemic card.
You may Discover a Cure at any Research Station  the color of its
city does not need to match the disease you are curing.
On your turn, you may take a card from another player, if you are both
in the city that matches the card you are taking.
On your turn, you may take any City card from the Researcher (only),
if you are both in the same city.
Your hand limit applies immediately after getting a card from
another player.

An agricultural development game for 1-5 players by Uwe Rosenberg
PLAYTING TIME:
Half an hour per player, shorter as a Family game.
AGE:
From 12 years

OVERVIEW:
Central Europe, around 1670 AD. The Plague which has raged since 1348 has finally been overcome. The civilized world is revitalized.
People are upgrading and renovating their huts. Fields must be plowed, tilled and harvested. The famine of the previous years
has encouraged people to eat more meat (a habit that we continue to this day).
The 17th Century: Not an easy time for farming
(Agricola is the Latin word for "farmer")


During the Feeding phase of the
Harvest, whenever you cannot or
choose not to produce enough Food
to feed your family, you must take

-1 point per unused space in the Farmyard
1 point per fenced stable & per Clay hut room
2 points per Stone house room
3 points per Family member

Note: The terms
"Person" and "Family
member" are used in
the rules and on the
game cards to mean the
round Family member
discs (see illustration);
"Player" means the
humans who are taking
part in a game of
Agricola.
The term "Other players" means
all other players  so not the player
taking the action.
Reverse sides:
The first game board has a different reverse
side which is used for the simplified
Family game.
The other two game boards should be
turned facedown during the rules explanation.
They have illustrative examples.
The reverse sides of two of the farmyards
can be used as supply areas for game
components, if the farmyards are not in
use in the game.
The "Occupation" and
"Minor Improvement" cards
are divided into 3 decks  a
Basic deck (E), an Interactive
deck (I) and a Complex deck
(K). To vary the cards that are
used in a game, players can
play with cards from only one
deck, can take a share of their
cards from each deck, or can
shuffle the decks together. The
deck that a card belongs to is
indicated by the symbol on the
right hand side of the card.

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
Players start the game with a farming couple living in a simple two-roomed hut. During
the course of the game, these families have abundant possibilities to improve their
quality of life by building up their home, improving their fields and breeding their
animals. In each of the game's 14 rounds, each of a player's Family members may take
exactly one action. They can generate building resources such as Wood and Clay, add
more people to their family, and ensure that they are fed. In each round, each action can
only be taken by one Person  players will miss out if another player chooses the action
first. A new action becomes available in each round  see Overview of game phases. You
must plan to grow your family at the right time  but not too soon, because even the next
generation must be fed. Growing your family is important, though, because it allows
you to take more actions as they become available. At the end of the game, the winner is
the player who has established the best farmyard  see Scoring overview. Victory points
are awarded for the number of fields, pastures and fenced stables, as well as for Grain,
Vegetables, Sheep, Wild boar and Cattle. Players lose one point for each unused farmyard
space. Additional points are awarded for extension and renovation of the family's home,
for the number of Family members, and for played Occupation and Improvement
cards. There are examples of play, with explanations, on the reverse sides of three
of the boards.

GAME SETUP:
Place the three game boards as shown in the illustration to the right.
Each player chooses a color and takes the playing pieces in that color, as well
as one farmyard. These are placed in front of the player (facing whichever direction the
player chooses). On each of the two building spaces on this farmyard, players first place
a Wooden hut room tile and then (in each of these rooms) one of their Family members.
(See Illustration, top right). The remaining playing pieces (additional Family members,
fences and stables) remain in the bag for now or are placed to one side. Sort the remaining
house and hut tiles and the rest of the game components and place them beside the playing
area.
For your first game(s) of Agricola, we strongly recommend that you use the "Family
game" rules given on page 8. The game is the same as the full game, except that it is
played without Occupation and Minor Improvement cards and with slightly different
Action spaces. Starting with the Family game is a great way to get acquainted with
the game before you try the full Agricola experience
Cards
Sort the cards according to the color of the reverse side.
Depending on the number of players, different green Action cards (B) are used .
There are also blue Round cards (A), yellow Occupation cards (C), orange "Minor
Improvement" cards (D), red "Major Improvement" cards (E), grey Begging cards (F) and
Summary cards (G).
A. Sort the blue Round cards according to the Stage of the game. Shuffle each small pile
and place the piles on top of each other with the cards for Stage 6 at the bottom, Stage 5
on top of that, etc  finishing with the four cards for Stage 1 on the top. The Round cards
make new actions available during the game. (These are listed on the game summary
cards and in the Appendix, section 1.2).
B. If you are playing with 3, 4 or 5 players, take the corresponding set of green
Action cards and place them face up on the spaces to the left of the first game board.
The order in which the cards are laid out is irrelevant. In a 3-player game, there are
4 cards, in 4- and 5-player games there are 6 cards. (There is more information about
these cards in the Appendix, section 1.3). In solo and 2-player games, no green Action
cards are used.
C. The purple symbol on the left side of the yellow Occupation cards shows how many
players the card is used for: means for 1-5 players, for 3-5 players, for 4-5
players. Cards that are not in use are removed from the game; the full deck of Occupation
cards is only available in a 4- or 5-player game. Shuffle the cards. Each player is dealt a
hand of 7 Occupation cards and may look through them. The remaining Occupation cards
are put to one side.

Once you have a Stone house, at the
start of a round, you can always either
pay 1 Food to play an Occupation
card or play an Improvement card by
paying its costs.

D. Shuffle the orange Minor Improvement cards. Each player is dealt a hand
of 7 Minor Improvement cards and may look through them. The remaining
Minor Improvement cards are put to one side.
E. Place the 10 red Major Improvement cards face up on the Major
Improvements board. As soon as 9 Major Improvements have
been bought, the board is turned over to show the scoring overview
and the remaining Major Improvement is placed on the space on the
reverse of the board.
F. Place the grey Begging cards face-up beside the playing area.
G. Each player takes a Summary card and places it in their
playing area. One side of the card gives an overview of the game
phases; the other explains the scoring at the end of the game.
There are no scoring rounds during the game.
Starting player
Players choose a starting player who receives the Starting player marker and 2 Food.
The other players each receive 3 Food. The Starting player marker is not automatically
passed on to the next player at the end of a round: it passes to the player who chooses the
"Starting player" action (see Illustration).

PLAY OF THE GAME:
The game consists of six stages, which are divided into 14 rounds.
Each round follows the same pattern and consists of four phases. There is a Harvest at the
end of each stage (after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14). This is shown on the game boards
as Harvest.
PHASE 1:
Start the round  draw a new Round card.
Turn over the top Round card and place it on the appropriate space on the board. The
action on this card is available to all players, and can be used not only in this round but in
all subsequent rounds.
All actions which occur at the beginning of a particular round or at the beginning of every
round occur now.
The text on some cards instructs players to place items on the Round card spaces. If there
are tiles, Food and/or other playing pieces on the space for the current round, these are
distributed to the appropriate players (who earned them by playing an Occupation or
Improvement) The functions of the cards are explained on page 7.
PHASE 2:
Replenish  place new goods and animals.
Place new goods and Food on any Action spaces on the board that require them (on the
printed spaces as well as on Action and Round cards). These spaces are shown by an
arrow (see Illustration). If goods or Food are already on a space, the new goods/Food are
added to them.
3 Wood means that 3 Wood tokens are placed on that space each round, 1 Cattle means
that 1 Cattle token is placed on the space each round, etc. The Fishing and Traveling
Players Action spaces receive 1 Food each round. These goods and Food are taken from
the general supply and can build up over several rounds  there is no upper limit.
PHASE 3:
Work phase
In clockwise order, starting with the Starting player, players take turns taking a single
Family member from their farmyard, placing it on an unoccupied Action space and taking
that action. Play continues until all Family members have been placed. A player may
only ever place one Family member at a time. Each Action space can only be used by
one Person in one round. A Family member may never occupy an Action space without
performing its action.
Some Action spaces offer players several choices of action or require a player to take
one action before (optionally) taking a second action. Whenever a player takes building
resources, Grain, Vegetables or Food, the tokens are placed in a player's personal supply
in view of the other players. Animals may not be placed in the supply; they must be
placed directly into the farmyard (See Action D, page 9).
In the Family game variant, the
yellow Occupation cards and the
orange Minor Improvement cards
are not used. In addition, some of
the Action spaces are different in the
Family game. (See reverse of game
board 1 and also page 9). Apart from
that, all the rules of the full game
apply.
The Starting player marker only
moves when a player chooses the
Starting Player action.
The Plowman receives fields in later
rounds; the owner of the Goose Pond
receives 1 Food for each of 4 rounds.
These are placed on the appropriate
Round card space(s)
The Traveling Players Action space
is only used in the 4- and 5-player
game. In the Family Game, Family
members can also obtain Food from
the Storehouse.
The Action cards are described individually
in section 1 of the Appendix.
Some Action cards give you a choice
of action, while others (optionally)
allow you to take an additional
action

During the Feeding phase of the
Harvest, whenever you cannot or
choose not to produce enough Food
to feed your family, you must take
1 Begging card for each missing Food.

-1 point per unused space in the Farmyard
1 point per fenced stable & per Clay hut room
2 points per Stone house room
3 points per Family member
Plowman:
Add 4, 7 and 10 to the current round
and place 1 field on each corresponding
Round space. At the start of these
rounds, you can Plow that field by
paying 1 Food.
Goose Pond:
Place 1 Food each on the next 4
remaining Round spaces. At the start
of these rounds, you receive the Food.

Animals that cannot be placed into the farmyard must be returned to the general supply or
immediately transformed into Food using an Improvement with the symbol. A player
who plays a card from their hand or buys a Major Improvement (see page 10) must read
the text on the card aloud so that all the other players are aware of its effects.
Players are not allowed to hide their personal supply from other players or to completely
cover cards that they have played.
PHASE 4:
Return home
Players remove their Family members from the game boards and return them to their
home.
Harvest Time
Players feed their Family members during the Harvest, which occurs at the end of each
stage of the game (see Appendix, section 6)  that is, after rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14
(see game boards 2 and 3). The Harvest consists of three phases, which occur one after
another.
HARVEST PHASE 1:
The Field phase
Players remove 1 Grain or Vegetable token from each Sown field in their farmyard (see
Illustration) and place them in their personal supply. Players may also receive additional
Food from Occupation or Improvement cards that they have played.
HARVEST PHASE 2:
Feeding the family
At the end of this phase, each player must feed his or her family by paying 2 Food
per Family member. Offspring that were born during the current round ("Newborn
offspring", typically from a Family growth action) only consume 1 Food for this round,
but will require 2 Food in future Harvests.
Each unprocessed Grain or Vegetable may be converted to 1 Food at any time. Fireplaces
and Cooking Hearths, as well as other specific Occupations and Improvements, allow
players to convert Vegetables at any time, at a better exchange rate. Improvements with
the symbol can be used to convert animals to Food at any time. Improvements with
the symbol can be used to Bake bread, but only when the player takes a Bake bread
action during a round.
Unprocessed animals have no Food value.

BEGGING:
A player who cannot or does not wish to produce the required Food must take a Begging
card for each missing Food  players may not give up members of their family to avoid
the need to Feed them. At the end of the game, players lose 3 points for each Begging
card.
HARVEST PHASE 3:
Breeding
Lastly, any player with at least 2 animals of the same type receives exactly one additional
(baby) animal of that type  but only if the lamb, the shoat (piglet) or the calf can be
accommodated in the farmyard (or on an appropriate Improvement card, for example
the "Animal Yard", "Wildlife Reserve" or "Forest Pasture"). Baby animals and parent
animals may not be converted into Food immediately after the birth (for example, if you
only have room for two animals of that type); they simply run away if they cannot be
accommodated. The animals breed regardless of where the parent animals are placed (see
Example)  the parents may be in separate areas.
End of the game
The game ends after the Harvest at the end of the 14th round (Stage 6), after which the
players' scores are calculated. There is a scoring overview on the back of the board for
Major Improvements and on the back of the Summary card, and the scoring is detailed on
page 8.
Tally each player's Victory Points on the scoring sheet. The player with the most points is
the winner. If there is a tie, the tied players share the victory (or can play another game of
Agricola to break the tie).
Example: A player who chooses the
Build room(s) and/or Build Stable(s)
Action space may choose not to build
a house and only to build stables. In
contrast, the After Family growth,
also 1 Minor Improvement action
does not allow a player to ignore
Family growth and only play a Minor
Improvement.
Additional possibilities for feeding
the family are offered by the Joinery,
Pottery and Basketmaker's Workshop.
These Major Improvements allow a
player to convert Wood, Clay and
Reed to Food during the Harvest (see
Appendix, Section 2).
Players with 3 or more animals of the
same kind do not get more than one
baby animal. There is room for this
baby animal in the stable.

ACTIONS:
Four main types of action can be taken to improve a player's farmyard. (A) Players can
extend and renovate their Wooden huts. (B) An extended home enables the family to
grow. (C) Fields can be Plowed and Sown and (D) Pastures can be fenced to hold animals.
Action A  Extend Wooden hut or renovate it into a Clay hut or Stone
house
At the start of the game, each player has a Wooden hut with two rooms. Players can
extend their huts by Building rooms using the Build room(s) action (see Illustration).
New rooms must be orthogonally (i.e. not diagonally) adjacent to the existing rooms (see
Illustration).
There is no upper limit on the number of rooms that a player may build.
New rooms are always made from the same material as the rest of the home. Wooden
huts can only be extended with Wooden rooms; Clay huts only with Clay rooms; and
Stone houses only with Stone rooms.
Extending a Wooden hut costs 5 Wood and 2 Reed (for the roof), a Clay hut 5 Clay and
2 Reed, and a Stone house 5 Stone and 2 Reed.
During the game, the Wooden hut can be Renovated to a Clay hut and, later, a Stone
house. The first Renovation Action space becomes available during Stage 2 (rounds
5 to 7).
To renovate your Wooden hut to a Clay hut, you require 1 Clay token for each room in
your Wooden hut, plus 1 Reed (for the roof). Turn the Wooden hut tiles over to show the
Clay hut rooms.
For the second renovation  from Clay hut to Stone house  you require 1 Stone token
for each room in your Clay hut, plus 1 Reed (for the roof). Replace the Clay hut tiles with
Stone house tiles.
Players can only ever renovate a complete hut. Rooms may never be renovated one at a
time.
The Renovation action only allows a single renovation. A double renovation from
Wooden hut to Stone house in one turn is not allowed.
Stables
A player who chooses the Build Room(s) action space on the left-hand board may choose
to instead, or in addition, build up to 4 stables for 2 Wood each. Stables provide shelter for
animals (see page 7).
Additional actions after a Renovation
The Renovation card for Stage 2 allows players to purchase a Major (or Minor)
Improvement after performing the renovation  players may not, however, ignore the
Renovation action and only play an Improvement. A second Renovation card comes into
play in the last round of the game (see Illustration). This allows players to Fence pastures
after performing a renovation. (See Action D on page 6).
Action B- Family growth
In Stage 2 (Rounds 5-7), the after Family growth, also 1 Minor Improvement action
becomes available. Players must have room for offspring in their home before they can
use this action  that is, they must have more rooms in their home than they have
Family members. After taking Family growth, the player may choose to purchase a
Minor Improvement (see page 7).
The Family growth even without room in your home action card
becomes available in Stage 5 (Round 12 or 13). With this action, a
player may grow his or her family regardless of the number of rooms
in their home.
A player who chooses a Family growth action adds their newborn
offspring to the Action space (see Illustration, left).
In the Return home phase, the new Family member is taken home
and placed in its room. If it doesn't have its own room, it shares a
room with another Family member. A Player who takes the Family
growth action will therefore have one additional (adult) Family
member to use from the following round onwards. The new Family
member is not available for use in the round when it is produced
 it must first grow up. Families are limited to a maximum of 5 members. A player who
already has 5 Family members in play may not choose the Family growth action.
Each Family member requires their
own room (Exception: see Family
Growth, below).
Example: Claudia selects the Build
room(s) action and builds the third
room of a Wooden hut with 5 Wood and
2 Reed (see picture, at the top). Next,
she chooses the Renovate action, pays
3 Clay and 1 Reed and turns the 3
rooms of the Wooden hut over to show
the Clay hut side. Later, she chooses
Build room(s) again, pays 5 Clay and
2 Reed and extends her Clay hut by one
room (see picture, below).
After this, she could extend her hut
again or pay 4 Stone and 1 Reed to use
Renovation again and swap the four
Clay hut tiles for four Stone house tiles
 any additional rooms she built would
then have to be made of Stone.

Action C  Plowing fields  Grain and Vegetables
A player who chooses the Plow 1 field action takes a field
tile and places it on an empty space in his or her farmyard.
If the player already has fields, the new field must be placed
orthogonally adjacent to an existing field. Players may use at
most 1 Plow Improvement each time they select the Plow 1 field
action.
A player who chooses Take 1 Grain takes one Grain marker
and places it in his or her personal supply  the similar Take 1
Vegetable action becomes available in Stage 3 (Round 8 or 9).
The Sow action allows a player to plant 1 or more empty fields: the
player takes 1 Grain from his or her personal supply and places it on an
empty (fallow) field, then adds 2 Grain from the general supply to the
field.
Instead of Grain, a player may also Sow Vegetables by taking
1 Vegetable from his or her personal supply and placing it on the empty
field. 1 Vegetable from the general supply is added to the field.
A newly planted Grain field holds 3 counters, a Vegetable field
2 counters (see illustration, top right).
Grain and Vegetables are harvested during the Harvest (see Play of the
Game on page 4, Harvest). Grain and Vegetables that are in a player's
personal supply may be converted to 1 Food at any time  or to more
than 1 Food with an appropriate Improvement.
If a field is emptied, it can be replanted using the Sow action  a
Harvested field does not need to be re-Plowed. In Stage 5 (Round 12 or
13), a new action allows players to Plow a field and immediately Sow
one or more empty fields (see Illustration).
Baking bread as an additional action when plowing
A player who chooses the Sow and/or Bake bread Action space may choose what to
do with any or all Grain counters in his or her personal supply. Grain may be sown in
empty fields (see above), be Baked into a loaf of bread and converted to Food or be left
in the supply. Baking bread requires an appropriate Improvement with the symbol.
A Fireplace allows one Grain to be converted to 2 Food, a Cooking Hearth converts it to
3 Food. A Stone Oven allows up to 2 Grain to be converted to 4 Food each and a Clay
Oven allows at most 1 Grain to be converted to 5 Food (see also Major Improvements in
Appendix, section 3).
Action D  Raising animals: Fence Pastures, Build Stables, Raise Sheep, Wild
Boar and Cattle.
Each player may raise exactly one animal as a pet in his or her home, regardless of the
home's size and type. The pet does not take a room away from a Family member.
To hold more animals, players must Fence pastures. Each pasture may only hold animals
of one type  Sheep, Wild boar or Cattle. Up to 2 animals may live on each square of the
pasture: Pastures that occupy 1 farmyard square can hold 2 animals; 2 squares can hold 4
animals; 3 squares can hold 6 animals etc.
During the course of the game, players may rearrange their animals at any time, as long as
these rules are followed. A player may release some or all of their animals at any time, at
will (for example, to make room for other animals in a farmyard space). Animals breed at
the very end of the Harvest (see page 5). Animals breed at the very end of the Harvest (see
page 5).
The Fences action allows a player to immediately Fence pastures at a cost of 1 Wood
for each fence. Fences border the pastures and are laid between the farmyard spaces;
one fence may border more than one pasture. Like rooms and fields, all of a player's
pastures must be orthogonally adjacent. Fences may only be built if they will create a fully
enclosed pasture, with fences on all sides. The edge of the farmyard board, stables, fields
and rooms do not count as fences. Each player may build at most 15 fences. Fields and
rooms may not be completely surrounded with a fence. Fences may not be demolished
once they have been built. If a player has already built pastures, any new pastures must
border the existing ones. You may subdivide an existing pasture by adding a fence or
fences (see example in the Appendix, section 1.2).
1 Grain becomes 3, 1 Vegetable
becomes 2. Players can use the Sow
action to sow several empty fields at
once. It is irrelevant whether Grain
or Vegetables was sown in the field
previously. If it has been completely
Harvested, it may be re-Sown.
Example: Jakob has 2 empty fields,
as well as 1 Grain and 1 Vegetable
in his personal supply. He uses the
Grain and Vegetables as seeds and
plants them in his fields, using the
Sow and/or bake bread action.
After Sowing, there are 3 Grain on
one field and 2 Vegetables on the
other. In each of the two following
harvests, he will receive 1 Grain and
1 Vegetable. After that, the Vegetable
field is empty. Jakob plows a new
field and chooses the Sow and/or
Bake bread action again. He plants
the two harvested Vegetables in the
two empty fields. He cannot plant
anything in the third field, because
it still contains one Grain. He uses
a Baking Improvement with the
symbol to bake his two Grain into
bread.
11 fences have created 3 pastures. In
one are two white Sheep (this pasture
is full), the next contains one Wild
boar and the large pasture (bottom)
provides grazing room for 3 brown

Enclosed farmyard spaces are considered to be "used" (See Scoring).
Building stables
Placing a stable in a pasture doubles the capacity of the entire pasture. Stables can be built
at a cost of 2 Wood using the Build room(s) and/or Build stable(s) Action space. They
may be placed on any space in the farmyard that does not already contain a room or a
field, and may not be removed. Stables need not be fenced in: each unfenced stable may
hold exactly 1 animal. Only 1 stable may be built in any farmyard space. A player may
fence the stable in later, in order to create a new pasture with doubled capacity.
Occupation and Improvement cards
At the start of the game, each player receives 7 Occupation cards and 7 Minor
Improvement cards.
A player who plays a card from their hand or buys a Major Improvement must read the
text on the card aloud so that all the other players are aware of its effects.
Occupation cards
A player can use the 1 Occupation Action space(s) to play one
of these cards face-up on the table.
On the 1 Occupation Action space that is printed on the lefthand
game board, a player's first Occupation is free, and each
additional Occupation costs 1 Food. In the 35 player game, a
second Occupation space has varying costs depending on the
number of players (see the appropriate Action cards).
The text on the Occupation cards applies to the player as soon as the card
is played. Cards that are in a player's hand have no effect on the game.
Several cards, including the Countryman, Acrobat and Net Fisherman, are
printed with a Claim symbol  if a player with one of these Occupations
meets the stated condition, a Claim token is placed on the appropriate
Action space with the arrow pointing towards the player with the claim.
Improvement cards
In addition to the Minor Improvements, there are also ten Major Improvement cards. In each
game, different Minor Improvements will come into play, but the same Major Improvements
are available in each game and may be used by any player. These are described in Section 2
of the Appendix.
The 1 Major or Minor Improvement Action space allows a player to purchase either a
Major or Minor Improvement  as does the Renovation space. Minor Improvements may
also be purchased  in conjunction with other actions  on the Starting player and Family
growth action spaces. Players may not choose the action After Family growth, also 1 Minor
Improvement and only purchase an Improvement: This card only allows an Improvement
after Family growth (see Action B  Family Growth on page 5).
The upper-right corner of an Improvement card shows its cost: goods that a player must pay
in order to play the card. Grain and Vegetables that are paid must be taken from a player's
supply and may not be taken directly from a field. Some Improvement cards (for example the
Cooking Hearth) have a slash, showing that the player may choose between two options to
pay for the Improvement.
Some Minor Improvements require the player to have a prerequisite  these are shown in the
top left corner. In order to play these cards, the player must have the required goods, tiles or
cards on the table in front of him or her. Of course, the condition is fulfilled if the player has
more than the required number of fields or cards.
Many Minor and all Major Improvements are worth Victory Points at the end of the game.
These are shown by the symbol at the left beside the picture. The Bonus Points symbol on
some cards (bottom center) indicates that they also give variable Bonus points  these are
described in the text on the card.
Some Minor Improvements (Traveling cards) are placed in the hand of the next
player to the left after they are played and acted on. These are indicated by the
brown arrows to either side of the illustration and the text on the card explains how
they are used.

Whenever you play 1 Occupation,
you receive 3 Food before you pay
the costs of the Occupation.

When the term "supply" is used on
a card, it always means the general
supply, unless it specifically states
otherwise.
As soon as a player who has played
the Net Fisherman uses a Family
member to harvest Reed, the green
Claim marker is placed on the Fishing
space. If there is still Food on the
space during the Return home phase,
the player receives it.
If one of your people uses an Action
space that provides Reed, you can
take all the Food markers from the
"Fishing" space in the Returning
home phase (Phase 4).
1 Occupation
(costs 2 Food)
If a card requires a player to have a
Vegetable (Grain) field, he must have
a field (or an Improvement card) with
Vegetables (Grain) growing on it. An
empty, plowed field does not count.
- 5 Food
(pre-printed)
- 5 Clay
- 3 Grain
(pre-printed)
- 4 Sheep
Some Minor Improvements are Upgrade cards. Playing these cards not only costs goods
but also requires the player to return an existing played or acquired Improvement. Upgraded
Major Improvements are returned to the Major Improvements board and may be bought
again by any player (including the same one as before). Upgraded Minor Improvements are
removed from the game.

SCORING:
The game is scored at the end of Round 14. The Summary cards have scoring tables, as
does the reverse side of the Major Improvements board. The following categories are
scored one after another:
Fields: All field tiles that are on the player's farmyard are scored, regardless of whether
they are currently fallow or are sown. A player with 0 or 1 fields loses 1 point. Each field
after the first scores 1 point, up to a maximum of 4 points for 5 or more fields. Players
score -1/1/2/3/4 points for 0-1/2/3/4/5+ fields.
Pastures: Points are awarded for fenced areas ("Pastures"), not for the number of
farmyard spaces that are fenced in ("Pasture spaces"). The size of the individual pastures
is irrelevant. A player with no pastures loses 1 point. Each pasture scores 1 point, up to a
maximum of 4 points for 4 or more pastures. Players score -1/1/2/3/4 points for 0/1/2/3/4+
pastures.
Grain and Vegetables: All of a player's Grain and Vegetables are scored  whether it is in
the fields or in the player's supply. A player with no Grain loses 1 point. After that, players
score 1/2/3/4 points for 1/4/6/8+ Grain. A player with no Vegetables loses 1 point. After
that, players score 1 point per Vegetable up to a maximum of 4 points.
Animals: A player loses a point for having no animals of a particular type. Players score
-1/1/2/3/4 points for 0/1/4/6/8+ Sheep; -1/1/2/3/4 points for 0/1/3/5/7+ Wild boar; and
-1/1/2/3/4 points for 0/1/2/4/6+ Cattle.
Unused farmyard spaces: No additional points are awarded for using farmyard spaces,
but players lose 1 point for each unused farmyard space. Farmyard spaces are counted as
"used", if they are fenced in or if they have a room tile, field tile or unfenced stable on
them. In other words, "unused" farmyard spaces are empty and unfenced.
Fenced Stables: Each fenced stable earns the player 1 point. No points are given for
unfenced stables. Players do not lose points for having no stables. An unfenced stable has
the advantage that the player avoids losing a point for having unused farmyard spaces.
Huts, Houses & Family Members
Players earn 1 point for each room in a Clay hut (so a player with 4 Clay rooms earns 4
points), and 2 points for each room in a Stone house (so a player with 4 rooms earns 8
points). Rooms in a Wooden hut do not earn any Victory Points.
Players earn 3 points for each Family member, up to a maximum of 15 points (as the
number of Family members cannot be greater than 5).
Points for cards
A point value is shown in a yellow circle on the left of the Minor and Major Improvement
cards. Players lose 3 points for each Begging Card that they hold at the end of the game.
Bonus points: The text on various Improvement and Occupation cards describes how
Bonus points are awarded. Cards which earn Bonus points have a Bonus point symbol at
the bottom.
Number of game components
The only game components that have been deliberately limited in number are the 5 Family
member discs, the 4 stables and the 15 fences for each player. If the other game components
run out, a substitute should be improvised. To help, there are also multiplication markers,
which multiply by 3 or 4 on the front and by 5 on the back. To show which resource the
marker applies to, one of the appropriate goods is placed on top of the marker. Some
markers are pre-printed with Food and Grain.
Agricola as a Family Game (for 1-5 people from 10 years)
In the simplified version of Agricola, the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards are
not used  players do not have a hand of cards.
The first game board is turned face-down, showing the "Agricola Family Game" side, and
in a 35 player game only the "Family Game" Action cards are used.
The Major or Minor Improvement action is restricted to Major Improvements.
Otherwise, the rules are the same as for the full game.
In scoring, enclosed pastures
are counted  not the individual
pasture spaces. In this example,
there are 2 pastures (not 3).
All of a player's Grain and
Vegetable markers are counted
 in the player's supply as well as
in the fields.
"Unused spaces"
means each space
in the farmyard that
is not covered with
a room tile, has not
been plowed into a field, that is not
enclosed by a fence and on which
there is no stable.

SOLO VERSION:
 (for 1 person, from 12 years)
To play a Solo game, start with 0 Food. The left-hand spaces
on the left game board remain empty, as in the 2-player game.
Otherwise, play the game by the same rules as the multi-player
game, taking your turns one after another. After you play a
Minor Improvement that should be passed to the player on the
left, it is removed from the game.
Exceptions: Adult Family members must be fed 3 Food each at
Harvest time (Newborn offspring are still fed only 1). The
"3 Wood" Action space only supplies 2 Wood in any round.
To play a series of Solo games:
After the first game, choose one of your played Occupations.
This is now a permanent Occupation and is placed face-up
before the start of all subsequent games without requiring any
Action to be used. You can use the abilities of the Occupation
card from the start of the game, just as though you had already
played it. Each subsequent game, you choose another played
Occupation to be added to your permanent Occupations. Reduce
the number of cards in your Occupations hand by the number of
permanent Occupations that you have, so that you have a total of
seven Occupation cards at the start of each Solo game. Once an
Occupation has been made permanent, it must be placed face-up
at the start of each subsequent game in the series.
Because you have more permanent Occupations after each
game, the goal score that you must reach goes up in each game:
In the first game, your goal is 50 points, then 55, 59, 62, 64, 65,
66 and 67 points. After the eighth game, the Solo game series is
over. (You can of course play on with all permanent Occupation
cards, in which case the goal score increases by 1 point per
game.) At the start of each game in the series, you receive 1 food
for every 2 points by which you exceeded the goal score for the
previous game (rounded down). Any cards from the previous
game that were not moved to the permanent Occupations are
shuffled into the deck.
Many Solo players enjoy choosing their own cards  even
determining the order of the Round cards. You can also try
the following three "contests": restrict your Occupation and
Improvement cards to only one of Deck E, I or K.

1. The Action Spaces
Some actions are printed directly on the game boards (1 .1) and others are on cards. Each
round during the game, a new Round card (1.2) is drawn. Depending on the number of players,
up to 6 additional Action cards may be laid out at the start of the game (1.3).
A player may never use an Action space without taking one of the actions shown on the
space.
1.1. Actions that are printed on spaces on the game board
The actions that are printed on the game board are the same each time the game is played.
They vary slightly in the Solo game and in the Family Game variant (see Rules).
Action spaces with an arrow: Players whose Family members use this space take all
the resources, animals or Food that are on the space. Food is found on the Fishing and
Traveling Players spaces and, in the Family Game variant, in the Storehouse. Apart from
these, the Action spaces are named after the goods that are placed on the spaces.
Build Room(s) and/or Stable(s): During the course of the game, each player may build
any number of rooms and at most 4 stables. Pieces must be placed immediately whenever
something is built.
Each stable costs 2 Wood and can be placed on a fenced or empty unfenced farmyard space.
A fenced stable doubles the holding capacity of a pasture. Each farmyard space can hold 1
stable. Each space within a pasture may have its own stable: the pasture's capacity is then
multiplied by 4, 8, etc. An unfenced stable can hold at most 1 animal and may be fenced later.
Building houses is explained fully in the Rules (see Action A). A new room must be
orthogonally adjacent to existing rooms.
Starting player and/or Minor Improvement: The player takes or retains the Starting player
token. He may play one Minor Improvement from his hand
Take 1 Grain: The player takes 1 Grain from the general supply and places it in her own
supply. She may not Sow the Grain immediately, even if she has fallow fields. To Sow it, she
must choose one of the Sow action spaces. (see Appendix section 1.2 and Rules, Action C)
Plow 1 Field: The player places 1 field tile on an unfenced, empty farmyard space of her
choice. If she already has fields, the new field must be orthogonally adjacent to the existing
fields (see Rules, Action C). Players may not un-Plow plowed fields (that is, a player may
never remove a field tile) for any reason.
1 Occupation: The player plays 1 Occupation card from his hand by placing it face-up on
the table and reading it aloud. The first Occupation card a player plays in a game is free; each
additional Occupation card costs 1 Food (see Rules, Occupation and Improvement cards).
Day Laborer: The player takes 2 Food from the general supply in the standard game, or 1
Food and 1 Building resource in the Family Game.
1.2. Action Spaces on the Round cards.
The game is divided into 14 rounds over 6 stages  the first stage lasts for 4 rounds, the
second for 3, the third to fifth for 2 each and the sixth for 1 round. In each round, a new
Action space is added into the game; this can be used in the round in which it is turned up
and in each subsequent round. Each of the 6 stages ends with a Harvest.
The Action spaces are described here in the order of the game stages.
Sow and/or bake bread (Stage 1): For a description of Sowing, see Rules, Action C. When
Sowing, a player need not Sow all her empty fields, some may be left empty. Bake bread
means that the player takes Grain from her supply (she may not use Grain that is on one
of her fields) and uses a Baking Improvement with the symbol to turn it into food. For
example, a Fireplace or Cooking Hearth can turn one Grain into 2 or 3 Food. Various Oven
Improvements allow players to bake Grain into even more food.
1 Major or Minor Improvement (Stage 1): The player may place either a Major or a Minor
Improvement. Major Improvements are shown on the red cards and may be placed by any
player. Minor Improvements are on the orange cards. Minor Improvements are held in a
player's hand  other players do not have access to those cards.
1 Sheep (Stage 1): Place 1 Sheep on this space in the Replenish phase (Phase 2) of each
round. A player who selects this action takes all the Sheep from the Action space and must
either put them into his farmyard (see Rules, Action D) or use an Improvement to turn them
into Food. Sheep that cannot be pastured or turned into Food are returned to the general
supply.
Fences (Stage 1): Fences cost 1 Wood per fence. A fence that has been built may not be
demolished. Huts do not create a natural border for a pasture  a pasture must be surrounded
by fences even along the side(s) of a hut, the edges of the game board and beside fields and
stables. A pasture may be divided into several pastures by adding fences (see example).
(Keeping animals in fenced pastures is described in the Rules, Action D).
Example: To the left is a pasture with
a stable. It can hold 8 animals. In the
example to the right, the pasture has been
divided. The first pasture can only hold 2
animals, the second (with the stable) can
hold 4.
1 Stone (Stage 2): This Action space is a normal resource space as described in section 1.1.
In Stage 4 (Rounds 10 & 11), a second Stone space enters the game.
After Renovation, also 1 Major or Minor Improvement (Stage 2): Renovating is
described in the Rules under Action A. A player may only use this space to purchase a Major
or Minor Improvement after Renovating. A player may not undertake both renovations,
from a Wood to a Clay hut and to a Stone house, in one action.
After Family Growth, also 1 Minor Improvement (Stage 2): A player may only use this
Family growth space if he has more empty rooms than Family members. It is irrelevant
how the family has grown before and whether the Family members are on the game board
or in the farmyard. A player may not ignore the Family growth action and only purchase the
Minor Improvement.
A Guest  acquired through a Minor Improvement card  does not count as a Family
member.
Family growth is described in the Rules, Action B; Minor Improvements are described in
section 3 of this Appendix.
Take 1 Vegetable (Stage 3): The player takes 1 Vegetable from the general supply and
places it in her own supply. As with Grain, the player may not immediately Sow the
Vegetable. To Sow Vegetables, she must later place a Family member on one of the Sow
Action spaces.
1 Wild Boar (Stage 3): This Action space is the same as the 1 Sheep Round card, but
instead of a sheep it adds a Wild boar to the game.
1 Stone (Stage 4): This is a normal building resource space (see above).
1 Cattle (Stage 4): This action space is the same as the 1 Sheep Round card, but instead of a
Sheep it adds a Cattle to the game.
Plow and/or Sow 1 field (Stage 5): The player who takes this action may Plow one field
and after that may also Sow: he may plant Grain or Vegetables from his personal supply into
any empty field on his farmyard (See Rules, Action C). A player need not Sow all his fields;
some may be left empty.
Family Growth even without a room (Stage 5): Unlike the other Family Growth card, this
is not dependent on the number of rooms. By using this action three times, a player could
possibly have 5 Family members in only 2 rooms. Note: If a player who uses this card later
extends her home, she may not use the other Family Growth card again until she has more
rooms than Family members: the new rooms must first be used for Family members that did
10
not previously have their own room.
After Renovation, also Fences (Stage 6): Round 14 is the only round of the game in which
there are 2 Renovation actions (so that more than one player can build a Stone house). A
player must Renovate to be allowed to Fence pastures. Players may never perform both
renovations (to a Clay hut and to a Stone house) with one action.
1.3. Special Action spaces that vary according to the number of players.
In a 3-5 player game, additional Action spaces ensure that there are enough actions available
for all the players. Those that do not simply award Building materials or food are described
here.
1 Occupation (3 players): A player who chooses this action may play 1 Occupation
card from his hand. This Occupation costs 2 Food, so is much more expensive than the
Occupations on the other Occupation Action space (see Appendix 1.1).
Take 1 Reed, 1 Stone and 1 Food (4 players): The player takes 1 Reed, 1 Stone and 1 Food
from the general supply and places them in his personal supply.
1 Occupation (4 players): A player who chooses this action may play 1 Occupation card
from his hand. If this is the player's first or second Occupation card, it costs 1 food, a
subsequent Occupation card costs 2 food.
Take 1 Reed, also 1 Stone and 1 Wood (5 players): 1 Reed is placed on this action space
each round. In addition, when a player takes this Action, he also takes 1 Stone and 1 Wood
from the general supply (Stone and Wood do not build up on this space over several rounds).
In a 5-player game, there are three action spaces on which a player must choose one of two
or more options. The restriction of only one Family member on any action space still applies
to these spaces: by taking an action, a player prevents other players from taking the other
actions on that card.
Take animals (5 players): A player who chooses this Action space has three
choices: Take 1 Sheep and 1 Food; Take 1 Wild Boar; or pay 1 Food for 1 Cattle.
The animal is taken from the general supply and is immediately placed in the
player's farmyard or turned into Food using an appropriate Occupation (e.g.
Butcher, Meat Seller) or an Improvement with the symbol).
Either 1 Occupation or, from Round 5, Family Growth (5 players): The player
may play an Occupation card from her hand. If this is the player's first or second
Occupation card, it costs 1 Food, a subsequent Occupation card costs 2 Food. From the start
of Round 5, a player may choose to take Family Growth instead of an Occupation.
Build 1 Room or Traveling Players (5 players): A player choosing this Action space may
either build a room or use the Traveling Players. Unlike the other Building space, this action
can only be used to build a single room. Each round, 1 Food is placed on the Traveling
Players space. If a player chooses the Building action, the Food remains on the Action
space. The Food cannot be taken by another player in this round because the Action space is
occupied.
2. Major Improvements
There are 10 Major Improvement cards. These have their own board, on which the cards are
laid out. Each Major Improvement card has its own place on the board. Once all but one of
the Major Improvements have been sold, the board is flipped to the reverse side, which has
an overview of scoring. There is a space for the tenth Major Improvement card on this side
of the board; it may still be bought.
Fireplaces and Cooking Hearths: A player may own several Fireplaces and Cooking
Hearths. The two Fireplaces only differ in their price. There is an inexpensive one for 2
Clay and an expensive one for 3 Clay. Similarly, the two Cooking Hearths are identical
except for their cost (4 Clay/5 Clay). A player who chooses the Major Improvement action
may upgrade a Fireplace to a Cooking Hearth by taking a Cooking Hearth and returning
the Fireplace to the Major Improvements board, where it is available for purchase again.
Fireplaces and Cooking Hearths are worth 1 VP each. They make Vegetables worth more
than 1 Food, and can turn animals into Food. They also allow the player to use the Bake
bread Action space (see Appendix section 1.2) to make Grain more valuable. The difference
between a Fireplace and a Cooking Hearth is that the Cooking Hearth produces 1 more Food
from Baking bread and from cooking Vegetables, Wild Boar and Cattle.
Clay Oven and Stone Oven: These allow players to Bake bread more efficiently and are
worth 2 and 3 VP respectively. Players may Bake bread as a one-time action immediately
after they have bought an Oven.
The Ovens cost 3 Clay and 1 Stone / 1 Clay and 3 Stone. Some Minor Improvements allow
them to be upgraded to a more efficient Baking improvement.
The Joinery, Pottery and Basketmaker's Workshop offer an additional scoring
opportunity for Wood, Clay and Reed. In each Harvest, up to 1 of the corresponding
Building resource may be converted into 2 or 3 Food (depending on the card). At the end of
the game, players with these cards earn up to 3 Bonus points for having several of the same
resource. These workshops each cost 2 Stone plus 2 Wood, Clay or Reed. At the end of the
game, each workshop is worth 2VP.
The Well provides 1 food for each of up to 5 Rounds. More importantly, the Well is worth 4
VP at the end of the game. The Well costs 3 Stone and 1 Wood.
3. Minor Improvements
The 169 "Occupation" cards (see Appendix, section 5) and the 139 "Minor Improvement"

Wet Nurse (K, 1-5): Players are allowed to build several rooms at once with the Build
Room(s) action. For 2 Food, the Wet Nurse allows an immediate Family Growth of 2
people, for 3 Food 3 people. The new Family members are placed on top of the Family
member that was placed on the Build Room(s) Action space. The newborns are available to
take actions in the following round.
Wood Buyer (I, 3-5): The card also applies to the 1 Reed, in addition 1 Stone and 1 Wood
Action space that is used in a 5-player game.
Wood Carver (K, 1-5): May only be used once in each Round. The player can place her
Wood supply on the Wood Carver card, to ensure that she does not forget the benefits.
Wood Distributor (K, 1-5): Occupations like Boar Catcher and Mushroom Collector may
mean that there is Wood on the Wood space that cannot be distributed evenly  in this case,
1 or 2 Wood are left on the Action space. The Wood Distributor, Foreman and Taster can
affect one another. A player who chooses to use the Wood Distributor cannot take back the
decision. A player who chooses not to use the Wood Distributor has until the start of the
Work phase (Phase 3) to reconsider.
Woodcutter (E, 1-5): see Wood Buyer.
5. Counters and tokens:
Counters and tokens are described in different ways:
Building resources:
Stone, Reed, Clay, Wood
Resources:
Building resources, Grain, Vegetables
Animals:
Sheep, Wild boar, Cattle
Goods:
All Resources, Animals
6. Variants
* 3:1 Exchange: At any time, a player may discard any 3 cards from his hand and draw the
face-down card at the top of either the Minor Improvements or the Occupations deck. This
card is placed in the player's hand.
* 10-3: Each player draws 10 Occupation and 10 Minor Improvement cards and discards 3
of each.
* Mulligan: At the start of the game (and only at the start), a player may discard all 7
Occupations and/or Minor Improvements and draw 6 new cards of that type. (If the player is
still unhappy, he can keep trying this, always drawing 1 card fewer than he discards).
* Draft: Before the game starts, each player receives a hand of 7 Occupation cards as usual,
then chooses one and passes the rest to her left-hand neighbor. Each player chooses one of
the 6 new cards and passes on the remaining 5. This continues until each player has 7 cards.
Repeat this process with the Minor Improvement cards.
This variant allows players to create better combinations of cards than with a purely random
distribution. We recommend that each player should have played Agricola at least 4-5 times
before trying this variant.
7. Cards played during a Harvest
The Harvest consists of three phases. The Improvement and Occupation cards can divide the
Harvest into up to 11 parts.
Harvest Phase 1: Field Phase
1. Start: Milking Shed.
2. During the phase: Forester, Milking Hand, Copse, Butter Churn, Spindle,
Loom, Milking Stool, Beanfield, Turnip Patch, Lettuce Patch, Acreage.
3. At the end of the phase: Water Mill, Corn Storehouse.
4. Between Phases 1 and 2: Harvest Helper.
Harvest Phase 2: Feeding the Family
5. Start: Baker.
6. During the phase: Cook, Schnaps Distiller, Schnaps Distillery, Master Brewer,
Brewery, Hand Mill, Plane, Spit Roast, House Goat.
7. At the end of the phase: Slaughterman, Slaughterhouse.
8. Between Phases 2 and 3: n/a
Harvest Phase 3: Breeding
9. Start: n/a
10. During the phase: Shepherd, Forest Pasture, Nature Reserve, Animal Yard.
11. At the end of the phase: n/a

GAME NAME:
Arkham Horror

OVERVIEW:
The year is 1926, and it is the height of the Roaring
Twenties. Flappers dance till dawn in smoke-filled
speakeasies drinking alcohol supplied by rum runners
and the mob. It's a celebration to end all celebrations in
the aftermath of the War to end all Wars.
Yet a dark shadow grows in the city of Arkham. Alien
entities known as Ancient Ones lurk in the emptiness
beyond space and time, writhing at the gates between
worlds. These gates have begun to open and must be
closed before the Ancient Ones make our world their
ruined dominion.
Only a handful of investigators stand against the
Arkham Horror. Will they prevail?
Arkham Horror is a game for 1 to 8 players (3 to 5
recommended), playable in 2 to 4 hours. The game is set
in the fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts, made
famous by H.P. Lovecraft in his writings about the
Cthulhu mythos.
In Arkham Horror, a terrible creature from beyond
time and space is waking, roused by the dimensional
gates that are opening all over the city. The players must
join forces to close all of the gates before this Ancient
One awakens. If the Ancient One defeats the players, all
of Arkham is doomed.
The players must work together as a team of investigators
to close all of the dimensional gates, seal them permanently,
or if that fails, defeat the Ancient One when it
awakens from its slumber.
In Arkham Horror, the investigators explore the city,
encountering places, people, and creatures both normal
and mundane. Through these adventures, the investigators
hope to gain the clues and resources needed to confront
and ultimately thwart the mythos threat.
Early in the game, investigators seek to avoid more powerful
monsters while moving around the city to gather
weapons, spells, clues, and other items they will need.
Later, the investigators attempt to close a few gates and
seal some of the most active gates.
Finally, once several gates have been sealed and the
investigators have acquired valuable weapons, spells,
clues, and allies, they make one last, desperate assault on
the mythos, attempting to close or seal the final gates.
Either they succeed and the world survives, or they fail
and the Ancient One awakens for the climactic battle.
Be warned: If the Ancient One awakens, the investigators
are in for the fight of their lives!

Before you play your first game of Arkham Horror,
carefully punch out the cardboard pieces so that they do
not tear. Next, slide the 16 plastic stands onto the bases
of the 16 investigator markers. Be sure to keep all components
out of the reach of small children and animals.
The following is an introductory summary of the various
components included in Arkham Horror. This summary
should help you identify the components and understand
the ways they are used as you read through these rules.
Game Board
The game board depicts the city of Arkham and the
"Other Worlds" to which investigators may travel during
the game. See "Game Board Breakdown" on page 21 for
a complete discussion of the game board.
FIRST PLAYER MARKER:
This marker is given to the player
who acts first in a turn. The marker is
passed to the left at the start of each
new turn.
DICE:
Players roll the dice to make skill checks, fight
battles, and determine other random outcomes.

This copy of Arkham Horror is from Fantasy Flight's
second printing of the game. This rulebook has been
revised from the first printing to incorporate the errata
listed in both version 1.1 of the Arkham Horror FAQ
(available at www.fantasyflight games.com) and in the
Dunwich Horror expansion rulebook. Three cards (Flesh
Ward, Healing Stone, and Lantern) and the starting possessions
of two investigators (Bob Jenkins and Jenny
Barnes) and have also been revised according to the
FAQ v1.1 errata. Otherwise, there are no changes to this
version that affect gameplay.
INVESTIGATOR SHEETS AND MARKERS:
Each player receives one investigator
sheet that describes the abilities,
skills, and starting equipment of the
investigator he controls. Each player
also receives one investigator
marker used to indicate his investigator's
current position on the
board. See "Investigator Sheet
Breakdown" on page 21 for a full
description of investigator sheets.
INVESTIGATOR STATUS TOKENS:
These tokens are used to track an investigator's current
Skills, Sanity, Stamina, Money, and Clues.
Skill sliders track the investigator's current
skill levels. Investigators make skill checks
throughout the game in the course of their
adventures.
Sanity tokens represent an investigator's
current level of mental health.
Stamina tokens represent an investigator's
current level of physical health.
Clue tokens represent vital insights and
information an investigator has accumulated
either before or during the game.
Investigators can spend Clue tokens to gain
bonuses on skill checks or to permanently
seal gates.
Money tokens represent the investigator's
current wealth. They are spent to purchase
equipment, pay fines, etc.
INVESTIGATOR CARDS:
The small cards included in Arkham Horror are called
investigator cards. They represent useful allies the investigators
may meet and items they may acquire during the
course of the game. There are six types of investigator
cards:
Common Items are ordinary but useful items that can
aid an investigator.
Unique Items are unusual, sometimes bizarre, and possibly
magical items that can greatly assist an investigator.
Elder signs, which can permanently seal gates, are
found in this deck.
Skill cards represent an investigator's abilities. Skill
cards typically either give a bonus to a certain skill or
allow you to roll the dice again when you fail a certain
kind of dice roll. Skill cards are rare and expensive to
acquire.
Spells are magical rituals that an investigator can perform
using the Lore skill.
Allies are people that offer to assist the investigators in
their adventures. Allies are the most powerful investigator
cards and can be found either at Ma's Boarding
House (a location on the game board) or through
encounters at some of the more dangerous and unstable
locations in Arkham.
Special cards represent unique privileges or obligations.
These include Retainers, Silver Twilight Memberships,
Bank Loans, Blessings, Curses, and Deputy of Arkham
cards. Special cards have a wide variety of effects.
ANCIENT ONE SHEETS:
At the beginning of every
game of Arkham Horror,
the players randomly determine
which Ancient One will
threaten the city. An Ancient
One sheet lists the powers,
combat statistics, and worshippers
associated with each
of these alien beings. See
"Ancient One Sheet
Breakdown" on page 19 for
full details.
DOOM TOKENS:
Doom tokens are
placed on the doom
track on the Ancient
One sheet as new
gates open in
Arkham. When the
doom track is filled
up with doom tokens,
the Ancient One awakens!
On the back of each doom token is an elder sign icon.
When an investigator successfully plays an elder sign to
permanently seal a gate, a doom token is removed from
the Ancient One's doom track, flipped over to its elder
sign side, and placed on the sealed location. Sealing a
gate using Clue tokens does not reduce the number of
doom tokens on the Ancient One's doom track in this
manner. For more information on sealing gates with
both elder signs and Clue tokens, see page 17.
ANCIENT ONE CARDS:
The larger cards included with Arkham Horror are
called Ancient One cards. These represent events that take
place within Arkham or the Other Worlds. These events
can include confrontations with monsters, beneficial
encounters, etc. There are three types of Ancient One
cards: Location cards, Gate cards, and Mythos cards.
Location cards represent the encounters that take place at
the various locations in Arkham. Each of the nine neighborhoods
on the game board has a deck of seven cards
dedicated to it, and each card has one encounter for each
of the locations in that neighborhood. For more information
on locations and neighborhoods, see page 21.
Gate cards represent the encounters that take place in
the Other Worlds. Unlike the Location cards, which are
divided into separate decks for each neighborhood, the
Gate cards are all shuffled together into one deck. For
more information on Other Worlds, see pages 89, 21.
Mythos cards depict major events in Arkham. One is
drawn each turn during the Mythos Phase. When a
mythos card is drawn, it has several effects. It identifies
a location where a gate opens, it determines monster
movement in Arkham, and it presents an event that may
affect the investigators. Most mythos cards also list a
location where a Clue token appears.

MONSTER MARKERS:
Monster markers represent the monsters roaming the
streets of Arkham. Each monster has two sides: a movement
side and a combat side. Leave the monster's movement
side face up while it wanders around the board.
When an investigator battles a monster, flip the monster
marker to its combat side. Players may look at either
side of any monster marker at any time. See "Monster
Marker Breakdown" on page 21 for a full description.
GATE MARKERS
These markers are placed on the board to indicate locations
where gates to the Other Worlds have opened.
Each gate marker identifies the Other World it leads to
and includes a modifier to the dice rolls of investigators
attempting to close the gate.
ACTIVITY AND EXPLORED MARKERS:
Activity markers indicate areas on the board where
unusual events are taking place. An explored marker is
placed underneath an investigator's marker after he has
braved the Other World beyond a gate and returned.
TERROR MARKER:
This marker is placed on the terror
track to indicate the mental state and
morale of the townsfolk of Arkham. As
the terror level increases, stores close
and people leave town, eventually
allowing the monsters to overrun the
town completely!
CLOSED MARKERS:
These markers are placed on locations
that have closed, whether because of
the terror level or specific events that
have occurred in the game. Neither
investigators nor monsters can enter
closed locations.
Activity Marker Explored Marker

GAME SETUP:
Place the Mythos-related items
on one end of the board. These
should include:
9 Location Decks
Gate Deck
Mythos Deck
Ancient One Sheet and Doom
Tokens
Gate Markers
Monster Markers (in an
opaque container)
Clue Tokens
Activity, Closed, and Explored
Markers
Place the Investigator-related
items on one end of the board.
This should include:
Ally, Common Item, Unique
Item, Spell, and Skill Decks
Special Investigator Card
Decks
Sanity and Stamina Token
Bank
Money Token Bank
Give the first player marker to
the player you've chosen to go
first. It is passed to the left at
the end of every turn.
Each player takes his investigator sheet and marker, then
gains Stamina and Sanity tokens equal to his maximum
Stamina and Sanity, respectively. In addition, each player
receives his character's possessions. Finally, each player
places his investigator marker on the game board on his
character's home location.
Place one Clue token on each of
the 11 unstable locations on the
board (marked by a red diamond
above the location).
Movement Side Combat Side
Follow the steps below to prepare for a game of
Arkham Horror.
1. PREPARE PLAYING AREA
Unfold the board and place it in the center of the playing
area. Make sure there is ample space around the
edges of the board to place the investigator sheets and
card decks. Place the various tokens and the dice near
the board, as shown in the setup diagram on page 4.
Make sure to place the terror track marker on the "0"
space on the terror track.
2. PLACE INITIAL CLUES
Place one Clue token on each location on the board that
has a red diamond above it. These locations are unstable
and represent the places where dimensional gates can
open and monsters can appear. Locations are identified
by circular illustrations overlaying the Arkham portion
of the game board (for example, Silver Twilight Lodge
and Ma's Boarding House).
3. CHOOSE FIRST PLAYER
Select one player at random to be the first player. Give
the first player marker to that player.
4. DETERMINE INVESTIGATORS
The first player shuffles the 16 investigator sheets. Then,
without looking, he randomly deals out one investigator
sheet in front of each player, including himself.
Alternately, the players may agree to choose their investigators,
starting with the first player and continuing
clockwise until every player has selected an investigator.
5. REVEAL ANCIENT ONE
The first player shuffles the eight Ancient One sheets.
Then, without looking, he selects one at random and
places it face up near the board. This is the Ancient One
that is threatening Arkham for this game. If the Ancient
One's ability lists any actions that take place at the start
of the game, such as Nyarlathotep's "Thousand Masks"
ability, they are resolved now.
Alternatively, the players may choose which Ancient
One they face. This is often helpful if there are time
constraints or other considerations involved. (Yig makes
for a shorter game, for instance, while Cthulhu makes
for a particularly challenging game.)
6. SEPARATE DECKS
Separate the various investigator and Ancient One cards
into their respective decks and place them near the board
as shown in the setup diagram.
7. RECEIVE FIXED POSSESSIONS
On each investigator sheet, certain items may be listed as
fixed possessions. Each player, beginning with the first
player and continuing clockwise, now receives the items
listed on his investigator sheet in the "Fixed Possessions"
area. The first player should locate the appropriate cards
in the investigator decks and pass them out to the players,
as noted on their investigator sheets.
8. SHUFFLE INVESTIGATOR DECKS
The players shuffle the Common Item, Unique Item,
Spell, and Skill decks, then return them face down to their
places next to the board. Whenever players draw cards,
they draw them randomly from the tops of these decks.
9. RECEIVE RANDOM POSSESSIONS
Each investigator sheet may indicate that the investigator
receives one or more random possessions. Each player,
beginning with the first player and continuing clockwise,
draws the indicated number of cards from the
appropriate decks, as listed on his investigator sheet in
the "Random Possessions" area.
Note: Abilities that affect drawing cards from the card
decks, such as Monterey Jack's Archaeology ability, do
work when drawing random possessions at the start of
the game.
10. FINISH INVESTIGATOR SETUP
Each player now receives a number of Sanity tokens
equal to his investigator's Sanity value and a number of
Stamina tokens equal to his investigator's Stamina
value. These values are listed on each investigator sheet.
Each player should place these tokens near the appropriate
area on his sheet.
Each player also receives three skill sliders and places
one skill slider on each of his three skill tracks. Each
skill slider may be placed on any one of the four "stops"
of each skill track. See "Adjusting Skills" on page 6 for
more information on skill sliders and skill tracks.
11. CREATE MONSTER CUP
Place the monster markers in an opaque container and
randomize them. A coffee cup, plastic container, or cloth
bag works well for this purpose. Throughout these rules,
we'll refer to this container as the monster cup. When a
monster appears or otherwise enters play, the first player
draws a monster marker randomly from the monster cup
and places it on the game board as instructed in these
rules or in the text of a specific card.
Exception: Do not place the five "Mask" monsters in the
container unless Nyarlathotep is the Ancient One. If any
other Ancient One has been revealed, remove the Mask
monsters from the game (simply return the markers to the
box). Mask monsters are identified by the word "Mask"
printed on the combat side of their markers.
12. SHUFFLE ANCIENT ONE
DECKS AND GATE MARKERS
The players now shuffle the Gate and Mythos decks, and
then return them to their places next to the board. Next,
they shuffle the 16 Gate markers and place them face
down in a stack next to the board.
13. PLACE INVESTIGATOR
MARKERS
Each player now takes the investigator marker depicting
his investigator and places the marker on the game
board location indicated on his investigator sheet in the
"Home" area. The other investigator sheets and markers,
as well as the unused Ancient One sheets, may now be
removed from the game.
14. DRAW AND RESOLVE
MYTHOS CARD
Finally, the first player draws the top card of the mythos
deck and resolves it as described in the Mythos Phase
section of the rules. If a Rumor is drawn, discard it and
draw again until you draw a mythos card that isn't a
Rumor. The mythos card will indicate an unstable location
where a gate and monster appear. Remember, unstable
locations are identified by red diamonds on the game
board. For more information on resolving the Mythos
Phase, see page 9.
Important: Remember to place a doom token on the
Ancient One's doom track after the first gate opens.
After the mythos card has been completely resolved, the
first turn begins, starting with the first player.
A turn in Arkham Horror is divided into five phases.
During each phase, every player, starting with the
first player and continuing clockwise, performs the
actions that take place during that phase. Once all
players have completed a phase, the next phase begins.
At the end of the last phase in each turn, the first player
marker is passed to the player on the left and a new turn
begins.
The phases of each turn are:
PHASE I: Upkeep
PHASE II: Movement
PHASE III: Arkham Encounters
PHASE IV: OtherWorld Encounters
PHASE V: Mythos
During each phase, every player, starting with the
first player and continuing clockwise, performs the
actions that take place during that phase.

THE GAME TURN:
During the Upkeep Phase, each player takes the following
actions, in order.
1. Refresh Exhausted Cards
Some cards exhaust themselves when used, which
means that they are turned face down for the remainder
of the turn. At the start of the Upkeep Phase, each player
refreshes those cards by turning them face up. Simply
remember that you can use face-up cards and that you
cannot use face-down cards until you turn them face up
again during the next Upkeep Phase.
Example: Richard (playing Harvey Walters) cast his
Wither spell last turn, forcing him to exhaust the card by
turning it face down. During the Upkeep Phase, Richard
turns the Wither spell face up once more. The spell is
now ready for him to cast again.
2. Perform Upkeep Actions
After refreshing his exhausted cards, each player must
review his investigator's cards to see if any of them
have an Upkeep action. Each player must perform all
Upkeep actions listed on his investigator's cards every
turn. Upkeep actions may be taken in any order the player
wishes. Bless, Curse, Bank Loan, and Retainer cards
do not require an upkeep roll during the first Upkeep
Phase after an investigator acquires them.
Example: Looking over his cards, Richard finds that he
has a Retainer card, which requires an Upkeep action.
First, Richard receives $2 for the Retainer. He takes two
money tokens from the pile of money tokens in the play
area. Richard must then roll a die to see if he keeps or
loses the Retainer. Richard is fortunate and keeps the
Retainer card for another turn.
3. Adjust Skills
Finally, each player may adjust his investigator's skills
using the three skill sliders he placed on his investigator
sheet during game setup. This process, as well as a general
description of how skill sliders work, is explained in
the "Adjusting Skills" diagram.
Exception: During game setup, players may set their
three skill sliders on any of the four stops on their three
skill tracks. This initial setup does not adhere to the normal
rules that restrict the number of stops a slider may
be moved each turn.
During the Movement Phase, each player takes one of
the following two movement actions, depending on
whether his investigator is in Arkham or an Other World
(see "Game Board Breakdown," page 21):

The two types of investigator movement are described
below.
Arkham Movement
If the player's investigator is located in Arkham (i.e., his
investigator marker is in the town area of the game
board), he receives movement points equal to his Speed
value, as found on his investigator sheet. A player may
spend one movement point to move his investigator
marker from one board area to another, so long as the
two areas are connected by a yellow line on the game
board. One movement point allows an investigator to
move from a location to a street area, from one street
area to another, or from a street area to a location.
Locations are indicated by circular illustrations on the
Arkham portion of the game board. Street areas are represented
by rectangular boxes on the game board, one
for each neighborhood in Arkham (for example,
Miskatonic U. and Rivertown).
Evading Monsters
Locations and street areas that contain monster markers
may affect an investigator's movement. Each time an
investigator attempts to leave a location or street area
occupied by one or more monster markers, the investigator
must either fight or evade each of the monsters there
(see "Evading Monsters" and "Combat" on pages 14 for
more information). Likewise, if an investigator ends his
Phase II: Movement
Phase I: Upkeep

ADJUSTING SKILLS:
During Upkeep, you may adjust your character's
skills in order to react to the investigator's
situation. Focus represents your character's
ability to split his attention between the
different tasks at hand. It determines the total
number of "stops" you may adjust your skills
each turn.
Example 1: Above, Amanda has a focus of 3.
This allows her to move her skill sliders a
total of 3 stops each turn. This turn, she
chooses to move her Speed/Sneak slider to the
right by 2 stops. Then, having 1 point of focus
remaining, she moves her Lore/Luck slider 1
stop to the left.
Example 2: This turn, Amanda decides to use
all of her focus to move her Fight/Will slider
3 stops to the right. She has no focus left to
move any of her other skill sliders, so they
remain where they were last turn.
Be careful how you adjust your skills, particularly
if your character's focus is low. If you
make your skills too one-sided, you can be
caught off-guard at a crucial moment without
the ability to react.

RETURNING TO ARKHAM:
Example: Amanda Sharpe is returning to
Arkham from The Dreamlands. She can
choose to move to either location that contains
an open gate to The Dreamlands. After
she does so, an explored marker is placed
under her investigator marker.
Amanda Sharpe starts her turn in the Graveyard, in Rivertown. Her Speed is currently
4, which gives her 4 movement points for the turn. She decides that she
wants to move to Administration, so her move breaks down like this:
1) 1 movement point to move from the Graveyard to the street area of Rivertown.
2) 1 movement point to move from the street area of Rivertown to the street area of
French Hill.
3) 1 movement point to move from the street area of French Hill to the street area of
Miskatonic U.
4) 1 movement point to move from the street area of Miskatonic U. to Administration.
ARKHAM MOVEMENT OTHER WORLD MOVEMENT
Example: Amanda Sharpe is in the first area
of The Dreamlands. During her movement, she
moves to the second area of The Dreamlands.
During her movement next turn, she returns to
Arkham, moving to any location with an open
gate to The Dreamlands and placing an
explored marker underneath her investigator
marker.
movement in a location or street area occupied by one or
more monsters, he must fight or evade each such monster.
If the investigator fails to evade a monster, the monster
immediately deals its combat damage to him (see
"Combat" on page 14) and he immediately enters combat
with it.
Once an investigator begins combat with a monster for
any reason, his movement is over. Regardless of whether
or not he wins the battle, the investigator loses the rest
of his movement points and must remain where he is.
Picking Up Clues
Any time an investigator ends his movement in a location
that contains Clue tokens, he may immediately take
any or all of those Clue tokens. The investigator may not
take any Clue tokens if he merely moves through the
location and then continues his movement: He must end
his movement in the location containing the Clue tokens.
OtherWorld Movement
Other Worlds are represented by the large circular
spaces along the edge of the game board. These spaces
represent bizarre locales, strange dimensions, and alternate
worlds that figure prominently in the mythos.
Players typically enter these worlds by exploring gates
(see "Gate," page 9).
Note that each circular space representing an Other
World is bisected by a prominent line: The areas to the
left and right of this line are the two areas of the Other
World.
If an investigator is in an Other World at the beginning of
the Movement Phase, he receives no movement points.
Instead, his movement depends on whether he is in the
first (left) or second (right) area of the Other World.
If the investigator is in the first area of the Other
World, he moves to the second area.
If the investigator is in the second area of the Other
World, he returns to Arkham. The player must choose a
location that contains a gate to the Other World he is leaving.
After choosing such a location, he places his investigator
marker there. Then he places an "explored" marker
underneath his investigator to show that he has explored
the gate. This marker remains in play as long as the investigator
remains at the location. If there is no open gate
leading to the Other World the investigator is in, the
investigator is lost in time and space (see page 17).
Delayed Investigators
During the game, certain effects can cause an investigator
to become delayed. When this occurs, place the
investigator marker on its side, indicating the delay.
Delayed investigators receive no movement points and
do not move during the Movement Phase. Instead, during
the investigator's Movement Phase, the player stands
the investigator marker back up to show that the investigator
is no longer delayed. On the following turn, the
investigator will be able to move once again as normal.
During the Arkham Encounters Phase, each player
whose investigator is in a location (not a street area or
Other World area) must take one of the following
actions. The action the investigator must take depends
on whether his location contains an open gate or not.
1. No Gate
If the location has no gate, the investigator has an
encounter at the location. The player shuffles the location
deck corresponding to the neighborhood his investigator
is in and draws a card from the deck. The player
then finds the entry for his investigator's location, reads
the entry aloud, and performs any actions indicated by
the card text. Note that the card may indicate that "a
monster appears," in which case the investigator must
either evade the monster (see "Evading Monsters," page
14) or fight it (see "Combat," page 14). Once the player
has resolved any actions indicated by the card, he
returns the card to the location deck.
Monsters and gates cannot appear in sealed locations,
even if this is directed by the text of a card.
PHASE III: Arkham
Encounters
8
Example: Amanda Sharpe is at the City of
the Great Race, which has a yellow and a
green encounter symbol. She begins drawing
cards from the gate deck. The first card
is red, so it cannot be encountered at the
City of the Great Race. The player discards
it and draws again. She draws a
blue card this time and again discards it.
Finally, she draws a green card and examines
it to see if it has a specific City of the
Great Race encounter. It does not, so she
looks at the Other encounter and follows
its instructions.
LOCATION ENCOUNTER OTHER WORLD ENCOUNTER
(NO GATE)
Example: Amanda Sharpe is at the
Historical Society in Southside, so she
draws a card at random from the
Southside location deck and looks at
the entry for the Historical Society.
According to the card, a janitor offers
her a ride to the Woods. If she accepts,
she moves to the Woods and has another
encounter there.
LOCATION ENCOUNTER
(WITH GATE)
Example: Amanda Sharpe is at Black
Cave, but there is a gate leading to the
Dreamlands there. Since she doesn't
have an explored marker under her, she
is drawn through the gate to the first
area of the Dreamlands.
Monsters that appear as the result of a location or gate
encounter never remain on the board after the encounter
is resolved. If an investigator evades such a monster,
return it to the monster cup (see "Monsters in
Encounters," page 22).
2. Gate
If the location has a gate, the investigator is drawn
through the gate. He moves to the first area (the left
area) of the Other World indicated on the gate marker.
Exception: Once an investigator has entered a gate and
returned to Arkham, the player places an explored marker
underneath his investigator marker. While he remains
in the gate's location, he is no longer drawn through the
gate, but may instead try to close or seal the gate (see
"Closing and Sealing Gates," pages 16-17). If the investigator
leaves the location before the gate is closed or
sealed, discard the explored marker. If the investigator
returns to the location later in the game, he will again be
drawn through the gate. He must resolve the Other
World Encounters Phase again before he can return to
the location and attempt to close or seal the gate.
Important: If an investigator is drawn through a gate
that appears as a result of an encounter (such as "A gate
appears!" or "A gate and a monster appear!"), then he is
delayed, just as if he had been drawn through a gate in
the Mythos Phase.
During the Other World Encounters Phase, investigators
in Other World spaces have encounters there. The Other
World spaces on the board are marked with circular
icons of different colors. These colored circles are called
encounter symbols. When an investigator has an Other
World encounter, the player draws cards from the gate
deck, one at a time, until he draws a card whose color
matches one of these encounter symbols. Gate cards that
do not match a color of the encounter symbols are
placed face down on the bottom of the gate deck.
Once the player has drawn a gate card that matches an
encounter symbol's color, he examines it to see if there is
a specific encounter for the Other World his investigator
is currently in. If a specific encounter is listed, the player
reads that entry aloud and performs any actions indicated
by the card text. If there is no specific encounter listed,
the player reads the "Other" entry aloud and performs
any actions indicated by the card text.
The card text of an Other World encounter may result in a
monster appearing, in which case the investigator must
either evade the monster (see "Evading Monsters," page 14)
or fight it (see "Combat," page 14). Once the encounter is
resolved, the player then discards the card face down to the
bottom of the gate deck.
Monsters that appear as the result of location or gate
encounters never remain on the board after the
encounter is resolved. If an investigator evades such a
monster, return it to the monster cup (see "Monsters in
Encounters," page 22).
During the Mythos Phase, the first player draws a
mythos card and performs the following actions:
1. Open Gate and Spawn Monster
2. Place Clue Token
3. Move Monsters
4. Activate Mythos Ability
Each of these actions is performed as follows.
1. Open Gate and Spawn Monster
The first player begins by looking at the lower-left corner
of the mythos card he has drawn to see where the dimensional
forces are assaulting Arkham this turn. One of three
things happens, depending on whether there is an open
gate, an elder sign marker, or neither at that location.
A. Location Has Elder Sign
If an elder sign token has been placed at the location,
nothing happens. No gate opens and no monster appears.
The elder sign has permanently sealed the gate at this
location, and no new gates can open here.
B. Location Has Open Gate
If there is already an open gate at the location, a monster
emerges from every open gate currently on the board.
This is called a monster surge. When a monster surge
occurs, the number of monsters drawn and placed is equal
to the number of open gates or the number of players,
whichever is greater. The first player draws monster
markers from the cup at random and places them on
each location with an open gate. When placing monsters,
they should be divided as evenly as possible among the
open gates, with no gate having more monsters placed on
it than the gate where the monster surge occurred this
turn. If there are more monsters to be placed than
allowed by the monster limit (see "Monster Limits and
the Outskirts," page 18), the players should decide
where monsters will be placed. The players must make
this decision before monsters have been drawn from the
cup. If the players cannot agree where the monsters are
to be placed, the first player decides the placement.
Example: There are 3 open gates (at the Black Cave,
Science Building, and Unvisited Isle), 7 players, and no
monsters in play when a mythos card is drawn that
opens a gate at the Black Cave. This causes a monster
surge: 7 monsters are drawn from the cup and placed on
the open gates. They must be distributed as evenly as
possible, so each of the 3 gates gets 2 monsters placed
on it, and the 7th monster is placed on the Black Cave,
where the monster surge occurred. The Black Cave now
has 3 monsters, while the other 2 open gates each have
2 monsters on them.
C. No Elder Sign or Gate
If there is neither an open gate nor an elder sign marker
at the location, a new gate opens and a monster emerges
from it. This means that the following things happen, in
order:
1. The Doom Track Advances
The first player places a doom token with the eye symbol
face up in the first available space on the Ancient
One's doom track. If the marker is placed in the last
available space on the doom track, the Ancient One has
awakened and the end of the game has begun (see "The
Ancient One Awakens!," page 20). If the Ancient One
awakens, you do not need to complete the rest of the
Mythos Phase: Proceed immediately to the final battle.
Note that it is also possible for the Ancient One to awaken
because there are too many gates open in Arkham at
once (see "The Ancient One Awakens!," page 20).
2. A Gate Opens
The first player draws a gate marker from the stack of
gate markers near the board and places it face up on the
location. Discard any Clue tokens that were on the location:
The investigators have missed their opportunity to
follow up on those leads.
3. AMonster Appears
The first player draws a monster marker from the cup at
random and places it on the location. If this would bring
the number of monsters over the monster limit, the first
Phase V: Mythos
Phase IV: OtherWorld

1. Open Gate and
Spawn Monster
2. Place Clue

3. Move Monsters
4. Activate Card's
Special Ability.
A. Each mythos card has a trait just below its title that tells you
what its subtype is. Mythos cards are either Headlines,
Environments, or Rumors. Each subtype behaves slightly differently,
and all are explained in detail in these rules.
RESOLVING A MYTHOS CARD
player places the monster in the Outskirts instead (see
"Monster Limits and the Outskirts," page 18).
Exception: If there are five or more investigators playing,
then draw and place two monsters instead of one.
Important: Unlike investigators, monsters are never
drawn through gates.
Example: Wade is the first player and draws the mythos
card shown in an earlier example. The lower-left corner
of the card shows Black Cave, which has neither an
open gate nor an elder sign marker. First, Wade adds a
doom token to the Ancient One's doom track. There are
still open spaces on the track, so Wade draws the top
gate marker from the stack and places it on top of Black
Cave. The revealed gate is one that leads to Yuggoth.
Finally, Wade draws a monster from the cup (a Dark
Young) and places it on Black Cave as well.
Gates Opening On Investigators
If a gate opens at a location that contains an investigator,
he is immediately drawn through the gate to the first
area of the corresponding Other World. As a result of the
sudden disorientation caused by the gate swallowing
him, the investigator is delayed. Place his investigator
marker on its side. The investigator will not move during
the next Movement Phase (see "Delayed
Investigators," page 16).
2. Place Clue Token
Most mythos cards indicate a location where a Clue
token appears. Place a Clue token on the indicated location
unless there is an open gate there. If one or more
investigators are at that location, one of them (they
should decide among themselves) may immediately take
that Clue token. If the players cannot agree on who gets
the Clue token, the first player decides.
3. Move Monsters
Although monsters start out in locations as they emerge
from gates, they soon leave those locations to roam the
streets of Arkham. In order to determine monster movement,
the first player looks at the lower-right corner of
the mythos card he has drawn for the turn. This area
describes which monsters move during the turn as well
as the direction they move on the board.
Each mythos card has two movement areas on it, represented
by black and white boxes. Each location and
street area on the board likewise features a black or
white arrow (sometimes both, see below).
Each movement box on a mythos card also has one or
more dimension symbols printed in it. Each monster
marker likewise features such a dimension symbol on its
movement side.
10
MONSTER MOVEMENT:
Example 1: The mythos card at
the left is drawn. Monsters showing
the symbols in the white area
(slash, triangle, and star) move,
following the white arrows.
Monsters showing the symbols in
the black area (hexagon) also
move, following the black arrows.
Specifically, in this example:
1. The Gug, with its slash symbol,
follows the black and white arrow
leading out of its current location.
B. The Dark Young does not move.
Although it has a hexagon symbol,
its border is yellow, indicating that
it is a stationary monster that
never moves.
Example 2: The mythos card above is drawn. Monsters showing the symbols in the white area
(square and diamond) move, following the white arrows. Monsters showing the symbols in the
black area (circle) also move, following the black arrows. Specifically, in this example:
1. The Dimensional Shambler, with its square symbol, follows the white arrow leading out of its
current location. Then, because it has a red border, signifying that it is fast, it moves one more
time (2), again following the white arrow.
A. The Dhole does not move. Although it has a circle symbol, it is sharing a location with
Amanda Sharpe, so it remains there instead of moving away from her.
Monsters currently on the board whose dimension symbols
are listed in either movement box on the mythos card
move to a connected location or street area, as follows:
If the monster is listed in the white movement box, it
follows the white arrow leading out of its current area.
If the monster is listed in the black movement box, it
follows the black arrow leading out of its current area.
Important: The arrows leading out of some locations
are black on one side and white on the other. These
arrows count as both a black arrow and a white arrow,
so monsters listed in either the black or the white movement
box of the mythos card follow that arrow.
Monster Movement and Investigators
A monster that already shares a location or street area
with one or more investigators does not move and
remains in place. Certain monsters move several times
(see the description of "Fast" monsters below); when
such a monster enters an area that contains one or more
investigators, it must immediately stop moving. No
encounter with the monster takes place during this
phase, but the investigators will be forced to evade or
fight the monster during the Movement Phase.
Example: A Star Spawn moves into Uptown, where Joe
Diamond and Ashcan Pete are currently located. During
their next Movement Phase, one or possibly both of
these investigators will need to deal with the Star
Spawn.
Monster Movement Specialties
Most monsters move as described above, but some monsters
have special movement abilities that follow special
rules. There are five different types of monster movement
in Arkham Horror. These are indicated by the
colored borders on the movement side of the monster
markers:
Normal (Black Border): Normal monsters move as
described above.
Stationary (Yellow Border): Stationary monsters never
move. They always remain at the location where they
entered play.
Fast (Red Border): Fast monsters move twice, following
the appropriate arrows for both steps of their movement.
Fast monsters stop moving immediately if they
encounter an investigator.
Unique (Green Border): Monsters with unique movement
(such as the Hound of Tindalos) have special
movement abilities listed on the combat side of their
monster markers. Turn such a monster marker over and
follow the instructions there.
Flying (Blue Border): Flying monsters generally move
directly towards the nearest investigator in a street area,
or move to the "Sky" holding area if they can't reach any
investigators this turn. Flying monsters are explained in
more detail in the "Flying Monsters"diagram.

FLYING MONSTERS:
Flying monsters are
indicated by a blue
border. When a flying
monster moves during
the Mythos Phase, it
obeys the following
rules:
A) If the flying monster is in a location or
street area with one or more investigators, it
stays where it is.
B) If the flying monster is in a location or
street area with no investigators and there
are one or more investigators in a connected
street area, it moves into that street area.
If there is more than one connected street
area containing investigators, it moves
towards the investigator in those street
areas with the lowest current Sneak skill
(including any relevant equipment and
skills; if there is a tie, the first player
chooses which investigator the monster
moves towards).
C) If the flying monster is in a street area
with no investigators and there are no
investigators in a connected street area, it
moves to the Sky (see The Sky, below).
THE SKY
The Sky is a holding area considered to be a
street area that is connected to every street
area in Arkham. Flying monsters in the Sky
can swoop down on investigators anywhere
in the streets of Arkham. Note that monsters
in the Sky count against the monster
limit (see "Monster Limits and the
Outskirts," page 18).
4. Activate Mythos Ability
Finally, the first player looks at the special text on the
mythos card, examining the trait listed at the top of the
card. The various traits indicate different types of
mythos cards, and they are resolved in different ways as
described below.
Headline: The first player immediately resolves the
special text of a Headline mythos card. He then discards
the mythos card face down to the bottom of the
mythos deck.
Environment: The special text of an Environment
mythos card remains in play for several turns, possibly
even until the end of the game. The first player places
the card face up next to the game board, discarding any
previous Environment mythos card face down to the
bottom of the mythos deck. This means that only one
Environment mythos card can be in play at a time.
Rumor: The special text of a Rumor mythos card
remains in effect until either the Pass or Fail condition
on the card is met, at which point the card is resolved
and is discarded face down to the bottom of the mythos
deck.
Only one Rumor can be in play at once. If there is
already a Rumor mythos card in play, ignore the special
text of the newly drawn Rumor and discard it face down
to the bottom of the mythos deck after resolving its
other effects for the turn (such as gate opening and monster
movement).
Other Effects: Additionally, the mythos card may call
for one or more "activity" or "closed" markers to be
placed on specific locations. Simply place the respective
markers on the locations indicated by the card. If the
card leaves play, remove the markers from the locations
as well.
Once the first player has resolved all steps of the
Mythos Phase, the first player marker is passed to the
left. The turn is now over and a new one begins with the
Upkeep Phase. Play continues in this way until the end
of the game.
The game ends in one of two ways: The investigators
either overcome the mythos threat, or they are defeated
by it.
VICTORY
The investigators win the game in any of the following
three ways:
A. Close the Gates
To satisfy this victory condition, the players must
accomplish two objectives:
An investigator must close the last gate on the board,
such that there are currently no open gates.
When the last gate is closed, the players must have a
number of gate trophies equal to or greater than the
number of players. These gate trophies do include the
one just awarded for closing the last gate, but do not
include any trophies the players have spent.
If these two conditions are met, the players immediately
win. Stability is restored to Arkham as the Ancient One
slips back into a deep slumber for a few more millennia.
B. Seal the Gates
If, at any time, there are six or more elder sign tokens on
the board, the players immediately win. The Ancient
One is driven away and peace returns to Arkham.
C. Banish the Ancient One
If the Ancient One awakens (see page 20) but the investigators
manage to defeat it, the players immediately win.
The Ancient One is banished beyond time and space.
SCORING VICTORIES
If the players achieve one of the preceding victory conditions,
the investigators have defeated the mythos threat
and saved Arkham. The player with the most gate trophies
is awarded the honorary title of First Citizen of
Arkham. In the case of a tie, the title goes to the player
with the most monster trophies.
You can rate your victory by using the following scoring
system. Start with the highest printed number on the
doom track of the Ancient One. Subtract the terror level
at the end of the game from this number. Now apply the
following modifiers:
1 per unpaid/defaulted Bank Loan
1 per elder sign played during the game
+1 per unspent gate trophy at the end of the game
+1 for every three unspent monster trophies held at the
end of the game.
+1 per sane, surviving investigator at the end of the
game
Example: The courageous investigators close the final
gate, returning Azathoth to his fitful slumber just as the
terror level climbs to 6. Subtracting the terror level (6)
from the highest printed number on Azathoth's doom
track (14) gives a base score of 8. The group had two
defaulted Bank Loans (2), played three elder signs during
the game (3), had eight unspent gate trophies (+8),
had 17 unspent monster trophies (+5), and had 5 sane,
surviving investigators at the end of the game (+5) for a
total of 21 points.
DEFEAT
If the Ancient One awakens and defeats all of the investigators
in battle, the space-time continuum ruptures, the
Ancient One is unleashed, and all of mankind suffers for
the investigators' failure. In this unfortunate event, all
players lose the game.
After reading the rules up to this point, you should be
familiar with the overall flow of the game, including
what you must accomplish to win. The remaining sections
of this rulebook offer everything you'll need to
know to meet those objectives: how to make skill checks
for your investigator, how to evade and fight monsters,
how to cast spells, how to close or seal gates, and more.
These are the basic abilities investigators use to accomplish
things in the game. Every investigator has six
skills, listed below. Investigators also have a value for
each of these skills, depending on how they have positioned
their skill sliders (see page 6). A skill value represents
the number of dice the investigator rolls for a
check based on that skill.
Fight: Used for physical feats of strength and
endurance. Also used in combat.
Lore: Used for tests of mystic knowledge and ability.
Also used in casting spells.
Luck: Used to determine the whims of chance. It is the
most common skill used in encounters.
Sneak: Used for feats of stealth and thievery. Also used
when evading monsters.
Speed: Used for tests of quickness and agility. Also used
to determine an investigator's movement.
Will: Used to test an investigator's force of personality
and willpower. Also used for Horror checks at the start
of combat.
SKILL CHECKS:
Investigators are often called upon to perform skill
checks in order to avoid harm or to accomplish something
in the game. When the game calls for a skill check,
it is presented in a consistent format that provides the
following information:
The skill you must use to perform the check
The modifier (bonus or penalty) to the check, if any
The difficulty of the check (not listed if the
difficulty is 1)
Example 1: Make a Sneak (1) check. In this example,
Sneak is the skill the investigator must use for the check.
The modifier is 1, a penalty in this case. Since it is not
specifically listed, the difficulty is 1.
Example 2: Make a Luck (+2) [2] check. In this example,
Luck is the skill the investigator must use for the
check. The modifier is +2, a bonus. The difficulty is 2.
When making a skill check, a player always rolls a number
of dice equal to his investigator's value in the appropriate
skill.
Modifiers and difficulties are discussed in more detail
below.
MODIFIERS:
This number is added to or subtracted from the investigator's
skill value before the player makes the check. The result is
the number of dice the player rolls to make the check. Note
that modifiers always apply to the number of dice a player
rolls for a check, not to the results of the individual dice.
Example: Michael McGlen is asked to make the two
skill checks listed in the example above. His current
Sneak is 3 and his current Luck is 2. In the first example,
he subtracts one from his Sneak of 3 (for the 1
modifier) and therefore rolls two dice. In the second, he
adds two to his Luck of 2 (for the +2 modifier) and
therefore rolls four dice.
Important: If the modifier reduces an investigator to 0
or fewer dice, he automatically fails the check. The
player may still spend Clue tokens to make the check
(see "Spending Clue Tokens on Skill Checks," below).
DIFFICULTY:
This is the number of successes an investigator must roll
during a skill check to pass the check. Each die result of
5 or 6 counts as one success. Remember that if a skill
check does not list a difficulty, it is assumed to be 1.
Example 1: Michael McGlen rolls two dice for the Sneak
check described above. He gets a 2 and a 5. The 5 is a success,
giving him a total of one success. Since the Sneak
check had no listed difficulty, it is assumed to be 1. Michael
has enough successes to pass the check.
Example 2: Michael next rolls four dice for the Luck check
described above. He gets 2, 5, 3, and 6, for a total of 2 successes
(the 5 and 6 were both successes). Since the check's
difficulty was 2, Michael passes the Luck check.
There are four types of special skill checks that players
should be aware of: Evade checks, Horror checks,
Combat checks, and Spell checks. Each of these special
skill checks are based on one of the six skills listed
above and are described later in this rulebook. If an
investigator receives a bonus to a skill, any special
checks based on that skill also receive this bonus.
However, if an investigator receives a bonus only to a
special check, that bonus does not apply to any other
checks based on the same skill.
For example, Evade checks are a special type of Sneak
check. A Skill card that gives +1 Sneak is useful both
for Sneak and Evade checks. However, an item that
gives +2 to Evade checks is only useful when making
Evade checks. That bonus cannot be used on a normal
Sneak check.
SPENDING CLUE TOKENS ON
SKILL CHECKS:
Clue tokens represent information about the mythos
threat that an investigator may acquire. A player may
spend Clue tokens, one at a time, after any skill check
(failed or not). Each spent Clue token allows the player
to roll one additional die; if the result is a success, it is
added to the total from the original roll.
Example: Joe Diamond fails a Lore (1) [3] check, but
gets two successes. Deciding that he really needs to pass
this check, he discards one Clue token and rolls another
die, getting a 3. Still no success, so Joe spends a second
Clue token and rolls a second die, this time getting a 6.
This extra success increases his total number of successes
for the check to 3, enough to pass the check.
Important: Spending a Clue token always gives you the
bonus dice that you are entitled to, even if the modifier
has dropped the number of dice you can roll below 0.
When an investigator attempts to move out of an area
containing a monster, or ends his movement in such an
area, he must either fight the monster or evade it.
An investigator may attempt to evade a monster by making
an Evade check. An Evade check is a skill check
using the investigator's Sneak value. The check is modified
by the monster's Awareness value, which is printed in
the upper-right corner of the monster marker's movement
side. The difficulty of the Evade check is always 1 unless
the monster has a special ability that states otherwise.
If the investigator passes the Evade check, he evades the
monster and the player may continue his turn as normal,
whether continuing movement or interacting with the
area. If the investigator fails the check, the monster
immediately deals its combat damage to him and combat
with the monster begins (see "Combat," later in these
rules).
Example: Ashcan Pete moves from the Merchant
District into Northside, where a Star Spawn is waiting
for him. Pete wants to continue moving to the Curiositie
Shoppe, so he must evade the Star Spawn. Pete's current
Sneak is 4 and the Star Spawn's Awareness is 1, so he
rolls three dice, hoping for at least one success. If he
passes the check, he has evaded the Star Spawn and may
continue moving. If he fails, the Star Spawn damages
him for 3 Stamina and he enters combat with it.
An investigator may remain in the same area as a monster
after evading it. He simply remains where he is and does
not have to enter combat with the monster this phase.
This allows an investigator to enter a gate in the same
location as evaded monsters. Such an investigator could
(if able) evade the monsters during the Movement Phase,
and enter the gate during the Arkham Encounters Phase.
Example: In the example above, if Pete successfully
evades the Star Spawn, he could choose to remain in the
Northside area without fighting it for now. However,
once the next Movement Phase takes place, he'll have to
deal with the Star Spawn once more (by either evading it
again or fighting it).
If there is more than one monster in an area, the investigator
must evade each monster in turn, in any order he
chooses. If he fails to evade a monster, the monster deals
its combat damage to him and combat with the monster
begins. If he defeats the monster, he must still fight or
evade any monsters in the area that he has not yet either
fought or evaded. Regardless of whether or not any further
evade attempts succeed, the investigator's movement
is finished as soon as he fails even one evade
check.
Example: If the Star Spawn in the example above was
also accompanied by a Shoggoth, Pete would need to
evade both of them to keep moving to the Curiositie
Shoppe. If Pete decides to evade the Star Spawn first
and fails the check, he can no longer move. Assuming he
wins the ensuing combat with the Star Spawn, he must
still either fight or evade the Shoggoth.
Sometimes monsters appear as the result of a location or
gate encounter. An investigator can evade these monsters
just like any others. However, these monsters never
remain on the board after the encounter is resolved. If an
investigator evades such a monster, immediately return
the marker to the monster cup.
Eventually, all investigators have to face their fears and
do battle with the mythos. Whenever an investigator
enters combat with a monster, resolve the following
steps, in order.
1. Horror Check
First, the alien nature of the mythos threatens to overwhelm
the investigator's mind. This is represented by a
Horror check.
A Horror check is a skill check using the investigator's
Will value. This value is modified by the monster's horror
rating (found in the lower-left corner of its combat side).
The difficulty of this check is always 1 unless the monster
has a special ability that states otherwise.
If the investigator passes the check, nothing happens. If
he fails the check, the investigator loses the amount of
Sanity shown underneath the monster's horror rating. The
player discards the appropriate number of Sanity tokens
from his investigator sheet. An investigator reduced to
zero Sanity tokens is driven insane (see page 16).
Example: Ashcan Pete failed to evade the Star Spawn,
so now he must make a Horror check. Pete's Will is currently
3, but the Star Spawn's horror rating is 3, so
Pete doesn't get to roll any dice for the check and automatically
fails. Pete loses 2 Sanity, as shown underneath
the Star Spawn's horror rating. Pete removes two Sanity
tokens from his sheet. If he had somehow managed to
succeed, nothing would have happened to him.
Whether he passes the check or not, an investigator only
needs to make one Horror check each time he does battle
with a monster. If the investigator successfully
evades the monster in the first place, he never needs to
make a Horror check at all.

EVADING MONSTERS
Example 1: Here, Amanda moves from the
Woods to the Uptown Streets, where the Dhole
is waiting for her. Amanda wishes to continue
moving to the Southside Streets, so she'll have
to make an Evade check. Her Sneak is currently
2, and the Dhole's Awareness is 1, so
Amanda will roll 1 die, hoping for a success.
Example 1A: Should Amanda fail her Evade
check, the Dhole immediately deals its combat
damage to her, and she loses 4 Stamina. If she's
still conscious, she then has to make a Horror
check, and if she survives that, she'll have to
decide whether to fight the Dhole or try to flee
from it again. Even if Amanda defeats the Dhole
somehow, her movement is over at this point.
Example 1B: Should Amanda pass her Evade
check, she successfully slips past the Dhole, and
her movement can continue as normal. In the
illustration above, she continues on her way to
the Southside Streets.
2. Fight or Flee
Next, the investigator must choose: He may either
attempt to flee or fight the monster.
A. Flee
The investigator tries to evade the monster, using an
Evade check just as described under "Evading
Monsters" earlier in these rules. If he passes the check,
he eludes the monster and the battle immediately ends.
If he fails the check, the monster deals its combat damage
to the investigator and the battle continues (see
"Monster Damage," below).
B. Fight
If the investigator fights the monster, he makes a
Combat check. A Combat check is a skill check using
the investigator's Fight value. This value is modified by
the monster's combat rating (printed in the lower-right
corner of its combat side). The difficulty of this check is
equal to the monster's toughness, which is represented
by the number of "blood drop" icons that appear in the
lower center of the monster's combat side.
If the investigator passes the Combat check, he defeats
the monster. The investigator's player removes the
marker from the board and places it in front of him as a
monster trophy. If the investigator fails the check, the
monster deals its combat damage to him (see "Monster
Damage," below).
Example: After failing his Horror check, Ashcan Pete
decides to fight the Star Spawn rather than attempt to
flee. Pete's Fight is 6 and the Star Spawn's combat rating
is 3, so Pete rolls three dice. The Star Spawn's
toughness is 3 (the difficulty for the check), so Pete must
succeed on all three dice to defeat the monster. If Pete
succeeds, he takes the Star Spawn marker and places it
in front of him as a monster trophy. If he fails, the Star
Spawn deals its combat damage to Pete.
Important: If a monster's toughness is greater than 1,
partial success has no effect on it. A monster must be
completely defeated in one Combat check or it ignores
all successes the investigator rolled.
3. Monster Damage
Each time an investigator fails to evade or defeat a monster,
the monster deals its combat damage to the investigator.
The amount of combat damage a monster deals is
printed below its combat rating. The investigator loses
Stamina equal to this number. The player discards the
appropriate number of Stamina tokens from his investigator
sheet. An investigator reduced to zero Stamina
tokens is knocked unconscious (see page 16).
Note that some monsters have abilities that add some
special effect to their combat damage. For example, the
Nightgaunt drops the investigator through the nearest
open gate instead of causing the investigator to lose
Stamina tokens.
If the investigator remains conscious, sane, and in the
same space as the monster after this step is resolved, the
combat continues. Return to step 2, Fight or Flee, and
continue the combat until it is resolved.
Example: Pete fails the Combat check, so the Star
Spawn deals its combat damage to him. The Star
Spawn's combat damage is 3, so Pete loses three
Stamina. Battered, bruised, and more than a little crazy,
Pete prepares for another round of combat.

COMBAT:
Example: Here, Amanda has decided to
fight an Elder Thing. The first thing she'll
have to do is make a Horror check. Her
Will is 2, but looking at the Elder Thing's
horror rating (A), she sees that its modifier
is 3, bringing her total down to 1,
which automatically fails. As a result, she
loses 2 Sanity, as shown beneath the
Elder Thing's horror rating.
Assuming that Amanda isn't driven
insane by the Sanity loss, she can now
make a Combat check to try to defeat the
Elder Thing. Her Fight is 3, and looking
at the Elder Thing's combat rating (B),
she sees that it has a modifier of +0, giving
her a total of 3 dice for her check. The
monster has a toughness of 2, so she'll
need 2 successes to defeat it. Crossing
her fingers, she rolls the dice and gets
this result:
The 5 and the 6 are both successes, giving
her the 2 successes she needed to defeat
the Elder Thing! She claims it as a monster
trophy.
If Amanda had failed, the Elder Thing
would have dealt its combat damage to her,
causing her to lose 1 Stamina and 1
Weapon or Spell of her choice. She would
then have to decide whether to fight it again
or try to flee from it. However, she would
not need to make another Horror check,
since she's already made one this combat.
USING WEAPONS AND SPELLS IN
COMBAT
Investigators can gain a valuable edge in combat by
using weapons and spells. The biggest advantage of
weapons is that they automatically grant bonuses on
Combat checks?no additional skill checks are required
to use them. However, most weapons grant Physical
Combat bonuses, which have no effect at all against
many mythos monsters.
Spells, on the other hand, grant Magical Combat
bonuses. These are effective against almost every monster
in Arkham Horror. An investigator must successfully
cast a spell to gain its benefits (see "Casting
Spells" below). If an investigator fails to cast a spell, it
provides no bonuses for the combat at all. In other
words, spells are more powerful and versatile than
weapons, but they are not always a sure thing.
Weapon and Spell Limits
There is a limitation on the number of weapons and
spells an investigator may use at once. This limitation is
represented by "hand" icons printed in the lower-left
corner of each weapon and spell card. Each investigator
may use any combination of weapons and spells and add
their skill bonuses together, as long as their combined
number of hand icons does not exceed two. Note that a
spell requires the number of hands printed on the card,
even if the investigator fails to cast it.
A spell or weapon that gives you a bonus (even one that
says it lasts until the end of combat) only continues to
give you the bonus while you devote the required number
of hands to it. You can choose to switch
weapons/spells in later combat rounds, but as soon as
you "release" a spell or weapon, it stops working for
you. Similarly, spells that are refreshed (such as at the
beginning of each combat round in the final battle) cease
to work and must be re-cast.
Example: Ashcan Pete has acquired some equipment
and a spell before he faces a Star Spawn. He decides to
use his .45 Automatic (a weapon that gives him a +4
Physical Combat bonus and uses one hand) and
Shrivelling (a spell that gives him a +6 Magical Combat
bonus if successfully cast and uses one hand). Pete successfully
casts Shrivelling. With the .45 Automatic and
the successful spell casting, he gains a total bonus of
+10 (+4 from the weapon, +6 from the spell). Adding
his Fight value of 6, Pete's total skill for the Combat
check is 16. He then accounts for the Star Spawn's combat
rating (3), leaving him with 13 dice with which to
roll 3 successes (as the Star Spawn's toughness is 3).
An investigator must successfully cast a spell in order to
gain its benefits. Every spell has a casting modifier, and
most have a Sanity cost. To cast a spell, an investigator
must pay its Sanity cost and then pass a Spell check.
To pay the Sanity cost of a spell, the player simply
removes a number of Sanity tokens from his total equal
to the cost of the spell. Players must always pay the
Sanity cost of a spell, whether or not the investigator
subsequently passes the Spell check.
A Spell check is a skill check that uses the investigator's
Lore value, adjusted by the spell's casting modifier. If
the Spell check fails, the spell has no effect. If the check
succeeds, the spell takes effect.
Example: Harvey Walters attempts to cast Heal, a spell
with a casting modifier of +1 and a Sanity cost of 1.
First, Harvey pays the Sanity cost , then he makes a
Lore (+1) check. His Lore is 4 at the moment, so he rolls
5 dice and gets 2 successes. The Heal spell is successful.
The spell's effect allows Harvey to recover Stamina
equal to the number of successes he rolled on the Spell
check, so Harvey recovers two Stamina.
This section of the rules describes the various conditions
that may affect an investigator during the course
of the game.
SANITY AND STAMINA:
An investigator begins the game with a number of
Sanity and Stamina tokens equal to the values listed on
the investigator's sheet. These two values are the investigator's
maximum Sanity and maximum Stamina.
While an investigator may gain and lose Sanity or
Stamina over the course of the game, the investigator's
current Sanity or Stamina may never exceed the investigator's
maximum Sanity or Stamina.
Insane in Arkham
If an investigator is ever reduced to 0 Sanity while in
Arkham, the investigator is driven temporarily insane.
He must immediately choose and discard half of his
items and half of his Clue tokens (rounded down), along
with all retainers (if any). The player then immediately
moves his investigator to Arkham Asylum. The investigator
is restored to 1 Sanity, returning 1 Sanity token to
his investigator sheet, and has no further encounters this
turn. The investigator may take his next turn as normal.
Unconscious in Arkham
If an investigator is ever reduced to 0 Stamina while in
Arkham, the investigator is knocked unconscious. He
must immediately choose and discard half of his items
and half of his Clue tokens (rounded down), along with
all retainers (if any). The player then immediately moves
his investigator to St. Mary's Hospital. The investigator is
restored to 1 Stamina and has no further encounters this
turn. The investigator may take his next turn as normal.
Insane or Unconscious in an Other
World
If an investigator is reduced to 0 Stamina or 0 Sanity
while in an Other World, the investigator is lost in time
and space. He must immediately choose and discard half
of his items and half of his Clue tokens (rounded down),
along with all retainers (if any). His Stamina and Sanity
are restored to a minimum of 1. The player immediately
moves his investigator to the Lost in Time and Space area
of the board and places the investigator marker on its side
to indicate that the investigator is delayed (see "Lost in
Time and Space," later in these rules).
Important: When adding up items before discarding
them, count all Common Items, Unique Items, and
Spells. In addition, the Deputy's Revolver and the Patrol
Wagon both count as items. Allies, Skills, and other
cards do not count towards this total.
DELAYED INVESTIGATORS
An investigator whose marker is placed on its side has
been delayed. Delayed investigators do not move during
the Movement Phase, and they receive no movement
points. Instead, when the player of the delayed investigator
takes his turn in the Movement Phase, he should
stand the investigator marker back up to show that the
investigator is no longer delayed.
ARRESTED INVESTIGATORS
Some encounters may result in an investigator being
arrested and taken to the Police Station. When this
occurs, the player should place the investigator in the
Jail Cell (rather than the main Police Station area).
Arrested investigators lose half of their money (round
down) and are delayed. The player completely skips the
next turn, simply standing his investigator marker and
placing it in the main area of the Police Station during
the Movement Phase. The player may act in the following
turn as normal.
Investigator Status
Casting Spells
LOST IN TIME AND SPACE
Any investigator who is lost in time and space is immediately
moved to the Lost in Time and Space area of the
board. The investigator is now delayed, and the player
should place the investigator marker on its side. The
investigator loses his next turn, remaining in the Lost in
Time and Space area. The player may only stand his
investigator marker back up during the Movement
Phase. On the following turn, at the start of the Upkeep
Phase, the player may move his investigator to any location
or street area of his choice in Arkham.
DEVOURED INVESTIGATORS
In rare cases, investigators may be devoured. The player
immediately discards all of his cards (except unspent
trophies) and shuffles his investigator sheet in with the
unused investigator sheets. The player then draws a new
investigator at random and sets up the investigator as if
he were starting a new game (as described in "Game
Setup" earlier in these rules).
If an investigator is reduced to both 0 Sanity and 0
Stamina at the same time, that investigator is devoured.
If an investigator's maximum sanity or maximum
stamina is reduced to 0, that investigator is devoured.
BLESSED AND CURSED
INVESTIGATORS
Blessings and curses represent aid or interference from
greater powers, and investigators may gain these cards
through encounters or rumors.
While an investigator is Blessed, every die result of 4
or better counts as a success.
 While an investigator is Cursed, only die results of 6
count as successes.
An investigator may never be Blessed and Cursed at the
same time. If a Blessed investigator is Cursed, simply
discard the Blessing. If a Cursed investigator is Blessed,
simply discard the Curse. Likewise, a player may never
have more than one Bless or Curse card at a time.
As dimensional gates open in locations all over Arkham,
the investigators must work to close or seal them.
CLOSING GATES
Before he can close a gate, an investigator must enter
the gate, explore the Other World it leads to, and then
return to Arkham.
When an investigator returns from an Other World, as
described earlier, the player should place an explored
marker under his investigator marker. This gives the
investigator an opportunity to destroy and close the gate
during the next Arkham Encounters Phase. If the investigator
leaves the gate's location for any reason, the player
must discard the explored marker  the investigator has
missed his opportunity and must explore the gate again
if he wishes to close it.
If, during the Arkham Encounters Phase, an investigator
is on a location that contains an open gate and that
investigator has acquired the explored marker, he may
now attempt to close the gate. To do so, the investigator
must choose whether to make a Lore check or a Fight
check, using the number printed on the gate marker as
the modifier. If the investigator succeeds at this check,
he closes the gate and takes the gate marker as a gate
trophy. If the investigator fails, the gate remains open.
The investigator can try to close it during the Arkham
Encounters Phase next turn (and in subsequent turns, as
long as he does not leave the gate location).
Closing and Sealing Gates
SEALING GATES
A: USING CLUE TOKENS
B: USING AN ELDER SIGN
To seal a gate using Clue
tokens, a player must:
1. Succeed at his roll to close
the gate.
2. Spend 5 Clue tokens.
3. Claim the gate marker as a
gate trophy.
4. Take 1 elder sign token
from the pile of unused tokens
and place it on the location
where the gate was sealed.
To seal a gate using an elder
sign, a player must:
1. Return the elder sign card
to the box (no roll to close the
gate is needed).
2. Claim the gate marker as a
gate trophy.
3. Take 1 doom token from the
Ancient One's terror track,
turn it over to its elder sign
side and place it on the location
where the gate was sealed.
This effectively decreases the
current doom track rating by 1.
SEALING GATES
If an investigator successfully closes a gate, he may
immediately spend five Clue tokens to permanently seal
it. The player takes a doom token from the pile of
unused doom tokens, turns it over to its elder sign side,
and places the token on the gate location. The player
still claims the gate marker as a trophy. The gate is now
sealed: No further gates can open and no monsters can
appear at the location of the sealed gate for the remainder
of the game.
MONSTERS AND CLOSING GATES
When a gate is closed, all monsters in Arkham, the Sky,
and the Outskirts that have the same dimension symbol
(see "Monster Movement," page 10) as the closed or
sealed gate are removed from the board and returned to
the cup. A monster's dimension symbol is printed in the
lower-right corner of the marker's movement side.
ELDER SIGNS
Elder signs are a specific type of Unique Item that
investigators can use to seal gates. There are several
elder sign cards in the Unique Item deck. To use an
elder sign, the investigator must be at the location of the
gate and must have acquired an explored marker, just as
if he were attempting to close the gate. The investigator
does not need to make a Lore or Fight check or spend
any Clue tokens to use the elder sign.
To use an elder sign, do the following:
The player removes 1 Sanity and 1 Stamina from his
investigator sheet. This may knock the investigator
unconscious or drive him insane, but the elder sign still
takes effect.
The player takes a doom token from the Ancient One's
doom track (not the pile of unused doom tokens), turns it
to its elder sign side, and places it on the location to be
sealed. This effectively lowers the current doom level of
the game by 1, and this is one of the only ways to do so.
The player then returns the elder sign card to the box.
This specific card cannot be drawn or used again this
game.
Once these actions have been taken, the gate is now
sealed: No further gates can open and no monsters can
appear at the location of the sealed gate for the remainder
of the game.
MONSTERS GUARDING GATES
During the turn he returns to Arkham from an Other
World, an investigator does not have to evade or fight
any monsters in the gate's location. This rule only
applies during the turn he returns to Arkham; in subsequent
turns, if the investigator remains in the location,
he must evade or fight any monsters there as normal.
There is a limit on the number of monsters that may be
in Arkham at one time. The limit is equal to the number
of players in the game, plus three.
This monster limit only applies to those monsters actually
moving around on the Arkham city portion of the
board or located in the "Sky" area. Monsters that appear
at a location and are then removed from the board do
not count, nor do monsters located in the Outskirts.
Important: If the terror level reaches 10, Arkham is
overrun and the monster limit is removed for the rest of
the game. See "The Terror Track," below.
If adding a monster to the board would bring the number
of monsters in Arkham above the monster limit, the
monster is placed in the Outskirts area instead.
Monsters in the Outskirts remain there until the
Outskirts become too full.
Number of Players Maximum Monsters in
Outskirts
When the number of monsters in the Outskirts exceeds
this limit, return all of the monsters in the Outskirts to
the monster cup and increase the terror level by 1. The
Monster Limits and terror level is described below.
the Outskirts
ANCIENT ONE SHEET BREAKDOWN
1: Name: The Ancient One's name.
2: Combat Rating: This is the Ancient One's combat
rating. It is only used if it awakens and the players
have to fight it.
3: Defenses: This section lists any defensive abilities
the Ancient One has. See Monster Special Abilities
on page 24 for descriptions of these abilities.
4: Worshippers: This section grants certain abilities
to one or more types of monsters. These abilities are
active all game long.
5: Power: This is a unique effect that the Ancient
One has on gameplay. Most effects are active all
game long.
6: Attack: This is the Ancient One's attack, only
used during combat with it. Some Ancient Ones also
have a Start of Battle ability that occurs only once,
when investigators begin to battle it.
7: Doom Track: This tracks how close the Ancient
One is to waking up.
BATTLING ANCIENT ONES
At the start of the battle, be sure that the Ancient
One's doom track is completely filled with
doom tokens. Immediately activate any Start of
Battle abilities the Ancient One may have.
Each round, players first get an Upkeep
Phase, then take turns making attacks on the
Ancient One, keeping a running tally of the
total number of successes they've scored as a
group. Each time they accumulate a number of
successes equal to the number of players or
higher (for example, 4+ successes in a 4 player
game), they remove 1 doom token from the
Ancient One's doom track and reset the success
tally to 0.
After each player has made an attack, the Ancient
One attacks. Often, the players will need to make
skill checks or suffer some misfortune, as
described on the Ancient One sheet.
ENDING THE BATTLE
Should the players remove the last doom token
from the Ancient One's doom track, the
Ancient One is defeated and they win!
However, if all of the investigators are
devoured, they have failed to stop the Ancient
One's arrival, and they lose the game.
The terror track shows the current terror level in Arkham
 the current mental state of the city's inhabitants. Various
things can raise the terror level, such as too many monsters
entering the Outskirts or the effects of some mythos
cards. The terror level can never go down, so players
should be very cautious about allowing it to increase.
When the terror level rises, move the terror track marker
up the terror track as indicated. The terror track marker
cannot leave the track, so the terror level cannot go
above 10.
Once the terror level has reached 10, if it ever increases
again (via a mythos card special ability, for example),
instead of moving the terror track marker, add one doom
token to the Ancient One's doom track for each point the
terror level should have increased.
"Margie, pack your bags!"
The most obvious effect of the terror level is that people
pack up and leave town. For every point the terror
level goes up, select one Ally card at random from
the Ally deck and return it to the box. That Ally is no
longer available for the rest of the game. Once all Allies
have been returned to the box or claimed by investigators,
this specific result has no effect for the remainder
of the game.
"That's it. I'm Moving the Shop to
Boston."
If the terror level reaches a sufficiently high level, the
Curiositie Shoppe, the General Store, and Ye Olde
Magick Shoppe close for the rest of the game.
If the terror level reaches 3, place a closed marker on the
General Store. It is closed for the rest of the game and
no one may enter that location. Immediately move any
investigators and monsters currently at the General Store
to the Rivertown street area.
If the terror level reaches 6, place a closed marker on the
Curiositie Shoppe. It is closed for the rest of the game
and no one may enter that location. Immediately move
any investigator or monster currently at The Curiositie
Shoppe to the Northside street area.
If the terror level reaches 9, place a closed marker on Ye
Olde Magick Shoppe. It is closed for the rest of the
game and no one may enter that location. Immediately
move any investigator or monster currently at Ye Olde
Magick Shoppe to the Uptown street area.
"Look at All the Monsters."
If the terror level reaches 10, the town of Arkham is
overrun by monsters and the monster limit is completely
removed from the game. There is no longer any limit on
the number of monsters that can rampage through town.
No matter how valiantly the investigators struggle, they
are facing incredible odds. Despite their best efforts, the
Ancient One may awaken and enter Arkham. If this
comes to pass, the only thing the investigators can do is
try to drive it back using the weapons and magic they've
accumulated throughout the game.
There are five conditions under which the Ancient One
may awaken.
1. Doom Track is Full
If enough gates open, eventually the Ancient One's
doom track will fill up with doom tokens, even if the
investigators use all of the elder signs. When a doom
token is placed on the last open space on the doom
track, the Ancient One awakens immediately.
2. Too Many Gates Open
If the investigators allow too many gates to be open at
the same time, this can awaken the Ancient One. The
number of open gates that will immediately awaken the
Ancient One depends on the number of players.
3. No Gate Markers
Finally, the Ancient One awakens immediately when a
new gate opens and there are no unused gate markers
left in the pile. Thus, if gate markers run low, players
should spend one or more gate trophies to replenish the
supply.
4. No Monsters in the Cup
The Ancient One also awakens if a monster should be
drawn from the monster cup, but there are no monsters
in the cup.
5. Terror Level 10 and Too Many
Monsters
The Ancient One also awakens if the terror level has
reached 10 and there are monsters in play equal to twice
the normal monster limit (for example, 16` monsters in a
five-player game).
Very Important: If the Ancient One awakens and its
doom track is not full, fill its doom track with doom
tokens before proceeding to the final battle.

GAME BOARD BREAKDOWN:
The game board is divided into several sections: Arkham
(A), the OtherWorlds (C), the Terror Track (D), and the
City Limits (EG).
The Arkham city section of the board shows the city of
Arkham divided into 9 neighborhoods, each of which
has between 2 and 3 important locations in it, as well as
a street area (B). The investigators move around on this
section of the board, passing through the streets to visit
the various locations. Each location is marked with a
number of icons showing the most common types of
encounters at that location.
The OtherWorlds (C) section of the board shows several
alternate dimensions that the investigators can enter by
moving through the gates that open up on the Arkham section
of the board. Investigators enter gates in order to
explore them and find some weakness that will enable
them to close the gate once they've returned to Arkham.
The Terror Track (D) section of the board tracks the current
terror level of the townsfolk of Arkham. If the investigators
allow the terror level of Arkham to get too high,
people will begin to leave town, making it difficult to
recruit Allies. Eventually the three shops in town (The
General Store, The Curiositie Shoppe, and Ye Olde Magick
Shoppe) will close down, making it more difficult for the
players to win the game.
The City Limits section of the board contains three special
areas: Outskirts (E), The Sky (F) and Lost in Time and
Space (G). Investigators that suffer a horrible fate of some
sort move to Lost in Time and Space for a short time.
Monsters on the board in excess of the limit wander out of
town to the Outskirts where they terrorize the inhabitants.
Finally, flying monsters move to The Sky before swooping
down on the next investigator they spot moving through
the streets of Arkham.
INVESTIGATOR SHEET BREAKDOWN MONSTER MARKER BREAKDOWN

Stamina higher than this number (although you can
increase this number).
4: Home: This is the location on the game board at

8: Skill Pairs: These are your character's skills.
They are paired so that if you increase one skill in a
pair, the other decreases.
THE FINAL BATTLE
When the Ancient One awakens, any investigators that
are lost in time and space are immediately devoured
and eliminated from the game. The surviving investigators
must face the Ancient One in the final battle!
Before the final battle begins, discard any active
Environment or Rumor cards. Additionally, once the
final battle begins, investigators should no longer collect
money or roll for Retainers or Bank Loans.
Combat with the Ancient One is divided into rounds.
During a round, players first have an opportunity to
adjust their investigators. Then, each player attacks the
Ancient One. Finally, the Ancient One attacks the investigators.
Once these steps have been resolved, a new
round begins. The structure of each round in a battle
with an Ancient One is as follows:
1. Investigators Refresh
At the beginning of a round of combat with an Ancient
One, the investigators may refresh their cards, use any
character abilities, and adjust their skill sliders as though
it were the Upkeep Phase. Next, the first player marker
should be passed to the left. Finally, they may trade
items among themselves as if they were in the same
location (see "Trading Equipment" later in these rules).
2. Investigators Attack
Next, starting with the first player and continuing clockwise
around the table, every player whose investigator is
still participating in the battle may make a Combat
check against the Ancient One using its combat rating as
the modifier.
Unlike a normal battle, the Ancient One cannot be
defeated in a single attack. Instead, keep track of every
success an investigator scores against the Ancient One
(see "Skill Checks," page 13). These successes are
cumulative, and each successive player adds to them
with his own attack. When the players accumulate a
total number of successes equal to the number of players
(including any players that were eliminated from the
game), remove one doom token from the Ancient One's
doom track and reset their cumulative successes to zero.
If the last doom token is removed from the Ancient One,
the investigators have defeated it! See "Ending the
Game" on page 12.
3. Ancient One Attacks
After all of the players (except eliminated players) have
made one Combat check against the Ancient One, the
Ancient One unleashes its attack on each of the investigators.
This attack varies by Ancient One, but they are
all extremely deadly. For example, Hastur forces all the
investigators to make an increasingly difficult Will
check or lose Sanity.
Any investigator reduced to 0 Sanity or Stamina by the
Ancient One's attack is devoured. If an investigator is
devoured during the final battle with the Ancient One,
that player is eliminated from the game (i.e., the player
does not draw a new character). If all investigators are
devoured, the Ancient One is unleashed on the world
and the players lose the game.
After the Ancient One's attack is resolved for each
investigator, a new round begins. This continues until
either the investigators defeat the Ancient One or all
have been devoured.
The following are some additional rules topics that
should help to clarify play of Arkham Horror.
DISCARDING CARDS
When you discard a card, return it face down to the bottom
of the appropriate deck. Players only shuffle most
decks when they draw a card that instructs them to do
so. Location decks, however, are shuffled before a player
draws from them. A player who draws multiple cards
from a Location deck draws them all, one after the other,
without shuffling between draws.
LOCATION SPECIAL ABILITIES
Some locations on the board have special abilities.
When an investigator enters such a location, the player
may resolve the special ability of the location instead of
having an encounter there. If there is an open gate at the
location, investigators cannot use the location's special
ability.
Example: The Science Building has the Dissection ability.
This ability allows an investigator to spend monster
trophies or gate trophies in exchange for Clue tokens.
An investigator at the Science Building may use this
ability instead of having an encounter there, and investigators
cannot use the ability if there is an open gate in
the location.
MONSTERS IN ENCOUNTERS
Many location and Other World encounters indicate that
a monster appears. To resolve such an encounter, the
player must draw a monster from the monster cup and
resolve the encounter as normal (i.e., the investigator
may attempt to evade the monster or fight it). No matter
how the encounter is resolved, the monster is never left
on the board. The monster is returned to the monster
cup, regardless of whether the investigator evades or
defeats the monster, or is knocked unconscious or driven
insane by it.
Many encounters state that "A gate and a monster
appear!" For these encounters, both the monster and the
gate stay on the board. However, many other encounters
state that just a monster appears. For example, one of
the Black Cave encounters states "A monster appears!"
and one of the Hibb's Roadhouse encounters states "A
horrible monster appears!" When a monster but not a
gate appears in an encounter, the monster does not stay
on the board. If such a monster is defeated, players may
take it as a trophy (unless its special ability says otherwise).
If the monster is not defeated, it is returned to the
monster cup, regardless of whether the investigator
evades the monster or is knocked unconscious or driven
insane by it.
Miscellany
SPECIAL CARD LIMITATIONS
In most cases, a player may never have more than one
copy of each special card at the same time. This rule
applies to Retainers, Bank Loans, Silver Twilight
Memberships, and Bless/Curse cards.
SPENDING MONEY
Often, investigators will be told that they can purchase
items "for list price" or "for $1 over list price." An
item's list price is always found in the card's lower-right
corner. Items are purchased by simply discarding money
tokens equal to the price listed.
SPENDING TROPHIES
There are several locations on the game board where
players can spend the monster and gate trophies they
have collected. For example, a player can spend monster
or gate trophies at the River Docks to gain $5. All monster
trophies spent in this manner are returned to the
monster cup, while all gate trophies are placed face
down on the bottom of the pile of gate markers.
TIMING CONFLICTS
If two or more game effects happen simultaneously, the
players choose the order in which they occur. If the
players cannot agree, the first player decides.
TRADING EQUIPMENT
An investigator in the same street area, Other World
area, or location as another investigator may trade
money, Common Items, Unique Items, and Spells. This
may be done before, during, or after movement, but not
during combat.

LOCATION ICONS
Above each location on the game board is either a green or red
diamond. This diamond indicates the relative danger of the location.
Locations with green diamonds are stable. Monsters and gates
will never appear in these locations, although it is possible for
monsters to move to them in certain circumstances.
Locations with red diamonds are unstable. Monsters and gates
can appear in these locations, sometimes even as a result of
encounters. These locations should be approached with caution.
Each location on the map also has several icons associated with
it. These icons tell the players the most likely outcomes they can
expect when they go to that location. The following is a key to
the icons you will find at different locations on the board:
Allies
Blessing
Clue Tokens
Common Items
Money
Additionally, each unstable location gives players the possibility
of encountering an Ally, and Clue tokens will often appear
in these locations as a result of resolving mythos cards.
Some locations have special location icons that have their colors
reversed, such as the Sanity icon on Arkham Asylum.
These icons indicate that there is a guaranteed method of
acquiring the described item at that location.
MONSTER SPECIAL ABILITIES
Common monster special abilities are described in detail below.
Ambush: Once combat has begun with this creature, the investigator
no longer has the option to flee it, but must instead fight until one
or the other is defeated.
Endless: A monster with this ability cannot be collected as a monster
trophy. Instead, each time it is defeated, return it to the cup.
Physical/Magical Resistance: AWeapon or Spell that adds a bonus of
the resisted type can only provide half its normal bonus (rounded up).
Example: Using a Tommy Gun (normally a +6 Physical bonus)
against a monster with Physical Resistance only gives a +3 bonus.
Physical/Magical Immunity: AWeapon or Spell that adds a bonus
of the resisted type provides none of its normal bonus.
Example: Using a Tommy Gun (normally a +6 Physical bonus)
against a monster with Physical Immunity gives a +0 bonus.
Nightmarish X: Any investigator that passes a Horror check when
facing this monster still loses X Sanity. This ability doesn't apply if
the investigator fails the Horror check.
Example: A Dark Young (Nightmarish 1) causes an investigator to
lose 3 Sanity if the investigator fails his Horror check or 1 Sanity if the
investigator passes. The Sanity loss from Nightmarish 1 doesn't apply
if the investigator has already failed the Horror check.
Overwhelming X: Any investigator that defeats this monster in
combat still loses X Stamina. This ability doesn't apply when the
investigator fails his Combat check against the monster.

PHASE SUMMARY:
The phases of the turn are as follows:
Phase I: Upkeep
Phase II: Movement
Phase III: Arkham Encounters
Phase IV: OtherWorld Encounters
Phase V: Mythos
During Upkeep, players perform any upkeep actions that are
required of them from turn to turn. This can include collecting
their pay, making payments on loans, refreshing their equipment,
and adjusting their skill sliders.
During Movement, investigators in Arkham move according to
their current Speed value. Investigators in Other Worlds
advance to the next area of the Other World, returning to
Arkham if they were already in the second area of the Other
World.
During Arkham Encounters, any investigator in a location
without a gate draws one location card from the location deck
for that neighborhood and follows the instructions on it.
Usually, Arkham encounters involve a skill check.
During OtherWorld Encounters, any investigator in an Other
World draws cards from the gate deck until he gets a gate card
matching the encounter symbol of the Other World he's in, then
follows the instructions on it. Like Arkham encounters, Other
World encounters often involve skill checks.
During Mythos, the first player draws 1 mythos card and
resolves it. First, one or more new monsters appear in Arkham,
sometimes along with a new gate, and a Clue token will usually
be placed as well. Next, some of the monsters on the board may
move through the city. Finally, the special effects of the mythos
card take place, which can cause the rules of the game to
change, either momentarily or for multiple turns.
SKILL CHECKS
Investigators are often called upon to perform skill checks in
order to avoid harm or gain advantages. These skill checks list
the skill to be used, which determines the number of dice the
player rolls for the check; the modifier to the check, which may
provide a bonus or penalty to the number of dice the player rolls;
and the difficulty, which determines the number of successes the
player must roll to pass the check (die results of 5 and 6 count
as successes).
SPECIAL SKILL CHECKS
There are four special types of skill checks that players should be
aware of: Evade checks, Horror checks, Combat checks, and
Spell checks. Each of these special skill checks use the value of
one of the six basic skills. Bonuses to the skill that a special
check uses apply to the special check as well. However, bonuses
to special checks cannot be used when making normal checks.
Evade checks are based on Sneak (see "Evading Monsters", pg. 13).
Combat checks are based on Fight (see "Fight", pg. 14).
Horror checks are based on Will (see "Horror Check", pg. 14).
Spell checks are based on Lore (see "Casting Spells", pg. 15).
TOO MANY GATES
If too many gates are open at once, the Ancient One can immediately
awaken.
Number of Players The Ancient One Awakens at:
12 8 Open Gates
34 7 Open Gates
56 6 Open Gates
78 5 Open Gates
Very Important: If the Ancient One awakens this way, fill
the doom track with doom tokens before proceeding to the
final battle!
MONSTER LIMIT
The number of monsters allowed on the board at one time is limited
by the number of players. Any monsters that would be
placed on the board beyond this limit are instead placed in the
Outskirts.
Monster Limit = (Number of Players) + 3
Important: If the terror level reaches 10, Arkham is overrun,
which means that the monster limit is removed for the rest of the
game.
MONSTERS IN THE OUTSKIRTS
If adding a monster to the board would bring the total number of
monsters in Arkham above the monster limit, then the monster
is placed in the Outskirts instead. Monsters in the Outskirts remain
there until the Outskirts becomes too full, as shown below:

When the number of monsters in the Outskirts of Arkham
exceeds this limit, place all of those monsters back in the cup
and raise the terror level by 1.
TERROR LEVEL SUMMARY
To summarize the effects of the terror level:
For every step the terror level increases, return one Ally at random
from the Ally deck to the box.
Additionally, the following events happen when a certain terror
level is reached:



GAME NAME:
Battlestar Galactica

The Cylons were created to make life easier on the Twelve
Colonies. And then the day came when the Cylons decided
to kill their masters. After a long and bloody struggle, an
armistice was declared and the Cylons left for another world
to call their own.
Forty years later, they returned, and brought humanity to the
brink of extinction. The remaining humans, led by the crew of
the Battlestar Galactica, fled in hope of finding a new home,
one known by legend as Earth.
Humanity's only hope lies in finding Earth's location while
fighting off the unrelenting Cylons. But as resources run low,
it is discovered that the enemy can now appear human and
has infiltrated the fleet from the inside.

OVERVIEW:
Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game provides a unique
gaming experience. Unlike most games where players win
individually, Battlestar Galactica is a team game, with the
added complication that which players are on which teams is
kept secret.
Each player is secretly assigned a team at the start of the
game. The two teams are the humans and the Cylons, and
each team has a specific objective. The human players are
trying to find the map to Earth, while the Cylon players simply
want to annihilate the human race. Players win or lose with
the other members of their team...but must figure out who
they can trust in order to lead their team to victory.

COMPONENT:
Game Board
The game board is where
the main action of the
game takes place. It
depicts the locations on
Galactica and Colonial
One, as well as the areas
of space surrounding
them. For a full diagram
of the game board,
see "Game Board
Breakdown" on page 8.
Battlestar Galactica
Resource Dials and
Plastic Connectors
The resource dials are used to
track the dwindling resources of
the humans. They are attached
to the game board using the
plastic connectors (see the
"Installing Resource Dials"
diagram on page 5).
Character Sheets
Each character has a
sheet that describes that
character's skill set and
special abilities.
Character Tokens
and Stands
Each character is represented by a token
that is slotted into a plastic stand.
Piloting Tokens
Each character who has the ability
to pilot has a corresponding piloting
token. A character's piloting token is
placed under a viper when that character
is piloting it.
Current Player Token
This token is used to help the players
remember which player is currently
taking his turn.
Nuke Tokens
The Admiral starts the game with two
nuke tokens. These powerful weapons can
destroy basestars, but are finite and should
not be wasted.
Civilian Ship Tokens
These tokens represent the
civilian ships that the humans
must protect during Cylon
attacks. These tokens have a
common back, and the face
lists the resources (usually
population) that are lost if that
ship is destroyed.
Basestars
These large tokens
represent the Cylon
basestars, which can
attack Galactica and
launch raiders during
combat.
Centurion Markers
These markers are used to track progress on
the Boarding Party track. Should any of these
tokens reach the end of the track, the humans
lose the game (see "Activate Heavy Raiders and
Centurions" on page 24).
Damage Tokens
These tokens represent the
vital systems that can be
damaged when Galactica or
a basestar is hit by an enemy
attack.
Fleet Marker
This marker is used to track progress on
the Jump Preparation track. When this
token reaches the end of the track, the
fleet jumps to its next destination (see
"Jumping the Fleet" on page 13).
Battlestar Galactica
Destination Cards
These cards are used when the
fleet jumps, to determine which
destination the fleet reaches.
Kobol
Objective Card
This card lists when the sleeper
agent phase takes place and how
the human players win the game.
Skill Cards
These cards are drawn by players at the
start of their turn. These cards are
used to overcome crises, or may
be played to provide special abilities.
Each character has access to
different skills and will therefore be
able to help overcome different types
of crises.
President and Admiral
Title Cards
These cards grant the owner
a special action, as well as
the ability to make important
decisions posed by certain Crisis
Cards. One player starts the
game with each of these cards,
but they often change hands
throughout the game.
Quorum Cards
These cards can be drawn by
the President, and can increase
morale, help deal with Cylon players,
or provide special abilities
for other players.
Crisis Cards
These cards represent the
different roadblocks and
disasters the human players
must overcome. Some of these
cards require skill checks, while
others represent Cylon attacks.
These cards are the main way
resources are lost.
Super Crisis Cards
These five cards represent
extremely dangerous crises.
When a Cylon player reveals
himself, he receives one of these
cards (see "Revealed Cylon
Players" on page 19).
Loyalty Cards
Each player is dealt one Loyalty
Card at the start of the game,
and another one halfway through
the game. These cards are kept
secret and inform each player
whether or not he is a Cylon (see
"Revealed Cylon Players" on page 19).
Eight-sided Die
This die is used primarily to resolve combat, but
may also be used by certain Crisis Cards.
Plastic Ships
These plastic ships are
used during Cylon attacks.
Their limited quantities
make them a precious
commodity.

Battlestar Galactica

GAME SETUP:
Follow these steps to prepare to play Battlestar Galactica:
The Board Game.
1. Place Game Board: Place the game board at the center of
the table. Set the food and fuel dials to "8," the morale dial
to "10," and the population dial to "12."
2. Set Up Tokens and Ships: Place the eight vipers and four
raptors in the "Viper and Raptor Reserves" space of the
game board. Then place the fleet token on the start space
of the Jump Preparation track. Last, place all other tokens
(facedown) and plastic ships adjacent to the game board.
3. Determine First Player: Randomly choose a player to be
the first player, and give him the current player token. This
player will choose his character first and take the first
turn of the game.
4. Choose and Place Characters: Starting with the first
player and proceeding clockwise, each player chooses a
character of the character type(s) that is most plentiful
(political leader, military leader, or pilot). This restriction
does not apply to support characters, who may be
chosen at any time. After choosing a character, the player
receives the corresponding character sheet and stand-up
character token, as well as a piloting token if applicable. He
then places his character token on the location specified
on his character sheet.
Example: The first player chooses Laura Roslin (a political
leader) as his character. The next player may choose any
military leader or pilot (since they are the most plentiful).
He could also choose a support character.
5. Distribute Title Cards: The President title is given to the
first available player in the following list: Laura Roslin, Tom
Zarek, and Gaius Baltar. The Admiral title is given to the
first available player in the following list: William Adama,
Saul Tigh, and Helo Agathon. The Admiral is then given the
two nuke tokens, and the President shuffles the Quorum
deck and draws one Quorum Card.
6. Set Up Loyalty Deck: Set up the Loyalty deck according to
the "Creating the Loyalty Deck" sidebar on page 6.
7. Set Up Other Cards: Shuffle the Quorum deck, Crisis
deck, Super Crisis deck, and Destination deck and then
place them next to the game board. Then separate the
Skill Cards into five decks by type, as shown on their
faces. Shuffle each deck separately, and then place
them (facedown) below the matching colored regions at
the bottom of the game board. Lastly, place the Kobol
Objective Card faceup next to the Destination deck.
8. Receive Skills: Each player, except the starting player,
draws a total of three Skill Cards from among any of the
cards he can draw during his Receive Skills step (see
"Receive Skills Step" on page 9). The starting player does
not receive Skill Cards now, but will draw Skill Cards at the
start of his turn.
9. Create Destiny Deck: Deal two Skill Cards of each skill
type facedown onto the "Destiny deck" space on the game
board and shuffle them thoroughly.
10. Set Up Ships: Place one basestar and three raiders in
front of Galactica. Then place two vipers below Galactica
and two civilian ships behind Galactica (as shown below).
Ship Setup at the Start of the Game
Installing
Resource Dials
Before playing the game for the first time, attach the four
resource dials to the game board. These dials are used
to track the fleet's dwindling resources throughout each
game. To attach a dial, simply push one side of a plastic
connector through the board, and the other side through
the dial. Then push them together until they fit snugly
together. Once attached, they should not be removed.
The number a given dial shows represents how much of
that particular resource is available at that time. When
a resource is lost or gained for any reason, its dial is
rotated to indicate the new total. If any resource is
reduced to zero (at the end of a player's turn), then the
human players lose the game.
Battlestar Galactica

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
The object of the game for a given player depends on which
team he belongs to. A player's team is determined by the
Loyalty Cards he receives throughout the game (see "Loyalty
Cards" on page 18).
All human players win the game if they travel at least eight
units of distance (as specified by the Kobol Objective Card; see
page 14) and then jump one final time (see "Human Objective"
on page 12).
All Cylon players win the game by preventing the humans
from reaching their objective. They usually accomplish this
goal by running the fleet out of a resource (food, fuel, morale,
or population), but can also win by destroying Galactica
(see "Damage Tokens" on page 25) or successfully invading
Galactica with centurion boarding parties (see "Activate
Heavy Raiders and Centurions" on page 24).
CREATING THE LOYALTY DECK:
1. Organize Loyalty Cards: Remove the "You Are a Sympathizer"
card from the Loyalty deck. Then separate
the remainder of the deck into two piles ("You Are Not
a Cylon" and "You are a Cylon"). Shuffle the "You Are a
Cylon" pile.
2. Create Deck: Deal the appropriate number of "You
Are a Cylon" and "You are not a Cylon" cards into the
Loyalty deck as listed below.
Three Players: Create a six-card deck consisting of:
1x "You Are a Cylon" card
5x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards
Four Players: Create a seven-card deck consisting of:
1x "You Are a Cylon" card
6x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards
Five Players: Create a 10-card deck consisting of:
2x "You Are a Cylon" cards
8x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards
Six Players: Create an 11-card deck consisting of:
2x "You Are a Cylon" cards
9x "You Are Not a Cylon" cards
3. Adjust Deck for Characters: Add one extra "You Are
Not a Cylon" card for each "Gauis Baltar" or "Sharon
Valerii" character playing.
4. Shuffle and Distribute: Shuffle the deck thoroughly
and then deal one Loyalty Card facedown to each
player.
5. Add Sympathizer: If playing a four or six player game,
add the "You Are a Sympathizer" card to the deck and
then shuffle it.
6. Place Deck: Place the remaining Loyalty deck next to
the game board. All extra Loyalty Cards (i.e., those not
added to the deck) are placed back in the game box
without looking at them.
Choosing Optimal
Characters
When choosing characters, it is important to be aware
of which characters have already been chosen. The last
player, in particular, should take the skill sets of other
players' characters into account when making his own
choice. For example, if no other players have chosen a
character with the engineering skill, it may be a good idea
to choose one who does have it.

Game Board Breakdown
1. Destiny Deck Location: Two cards of each Skill Card
type are placed here to form the Destiny Deck. Two
cards from this deck are added to every skill check.
2. Damaged Viper Box: When a viper is damaged, it is
placed here.
3. Viper and Raptor Reserves: All vipers and raptors that
have not been launched, damaged, or destroyed are
placed here. This space is often referred to as simply
the "Reserves."
4. Resource Dials: These dials keep track of the fleet's
dwindling resources.
5. Colonial One Locations: These locations may be moved
to and activated by human players. Players must discard
a Skill Card to move between Colonial One and Galactica.
6. Cylon Locations: When a Cylon player is revealed, his
character token is moved to, and then among, these
locations. Other players may never move to or activate
these locations.
7. Jump Preparation Track: The fleet marker is placed on
this track, and marks how close the fleet is to jumping.
8. Boarding Party Track: Centurion markers are placed
on this track. If a centurion marker reaches the end of
this track, then the humans lose the game.
9. Space Areas: Basestars, civilian, and plastic ships are
placed in these six areas, each separated by thick blue
lines. The concentric circles in space areas have no
game effect.
10. Galactica Location: These locations may be moved
to and activated by the human players. Players must
discard a Skill Card to move between Galactica and
Colonial One.
11. Hazard Locations: These two locations have ongoing
negative effects. Players may never voluntarily move to
these locations.
12. Viper Launch Icons: These icons represent the space
areas in which vipers may be launched. Note that there
are no launch icons on the other side of Galactica
because, thematically, the starboard hangar deck was a
museum and later housed refugees.
13. Skill Deck Regions: These colored regions mark where
the appropriate Skill decks should be placed.

GAME TURN:

number of game turns. Starting with the first player and
proceeding clockwise, players take complete game turns in
order until either the human or Cylon players have won the
game. Each game turn consists of the following steps, carried
out in order:
1. Receive Skills Step: The current player draws the number
and types of Skill Cards listed on his character sheet (see
"Receive Skills Step" on this page).
2. Movement Step: The current player may move to a different
location. If he moves to a different ship (from Galactica
to Colonial One or vice versa), he must discard one Skill
Card from his hand.
3. Action Step: The current player chooses one action to
perform. Options include the actions listed on his location,
character sheet, and Skill Cards (see the full list of actions
on page 10).
4. Crisis Step: The top card of the Crisis deck is drawn and
then resolved (see "Crisis Step" on page 10).
5. Activate Cylon Ships Step (if necessary): If any are in
play, Cylon ships are activated according to the Crisis Card
drawn (see "Activate Cylon Ships Step" on page 11).
6. Prepare for Jump Step (if necessary): If the Crisis Card
has the "prepare for jump" icon on it (see "Prepare for
Jump Step" on page 11), the fleet token advances one
space up the Jump Preparation track. If the token reaches
the end of this track, then the fleet jumps (see "Jumping
the Fleet" on page 13).
After the Prepare for Jump step, the current player's turn
is over, and he hands the current player token clockwise to
the player on his left. This player then begins his turn starting
with the Receive Skills step.
Game Turn Detail
The following section explains each step of a player's turn in
detail.
Receive Skills Step
During this step, the current player draws Skill Cards
according to the skill set listed on his character sheet. The
player always draws the cards listed on his character sheet
regardless of the number of cards already in his hand.
William Adama's Skill Set
Example: It is William Adama's Receive Skills step. He looks at
his skill set, which lists 3 leadership and 2 tactics. He therefore
draws three leadership Skill Cards and two tactics cards.
Some character sheets list multi-colored skills known as
multi-skills. When a character with a multi-skill receives Skill
Cards, he must first decide how many cards he will draw from
each type. The total number of cards that he draws must be
equal to the number listed on his sheet.
Example of a Multi-Skill
Example: It is the start of Lee "Apollo" Adama's turn. He therefore
draws two piloting and one tactics Skill Cards according
to the skill set listed on his character sheet. He may then
decide to draw two leadership or two politics Skill Cards  or
one of each  since he has a 2 leadership/politics multi-skill.
Battlestar Galactica
Movement Step
During this step, the current player may move his character
token to another location if he wishes. If he moves to a different
ship, he must discard one Skill Card from his hand. Human
characters may not move to Cylon locations, and revealed
Cylons may only move to Cylon locations.
Example: It is Lee "Apollo" Adama's movement step, and he
wishes to move from "Command" (on Galactica) to the "Press
Room" (on Colonial One). He discards a piloting Skill Card from
his hand and moves to the "Press Room" location.
If the player's character is piloting a viper, he may move to an
adjacent space area during this step, or may discard a Skill
Card to move to a location on Galactica or Colonial One and
return his viper to the "Reserves."
Action Step
During this step, the current player chooses one action to
perform. The action types are listed below, and are usually
identified by the word "Action:" followed by an ability.
Activate Location: The player may perform the action
listed on his character's current location.
Skill Card Action: The player may play a Skill Card from
his hand to perform the action specified on the card. Note
that not all Skill Cards have actions on them (see "Skill
Cards" on page 15).
 Character Action: The player may perform an action
listed on his character sheet. Note that only some character
sheets have actions listed on them.
 Activate his Viper: If the player is piloting a viper, he may
activate it to move or to attack a Cylon ship.
 Title and Quorum Cards: If the player has a Title or Quorum
Card that provides him with an action, then he may
perform it during this step.
 Loyalty Card: The character may reveal one of his "You
are a Cylon" Loyalty Cards to perform the specified action
on it. He then follows the rules for revealed Cylon players
on page 19.
 Do Nothing: If the player does not wish to perform any
actions, he may decide to do nothing during this step and
proceed to the Crisis step.
Crisis Step
During this step, the current player draws the top card of
the Crisis deck, reads it aloud, and then resolves it. There are
three types of Crisis Cards: Cylon attacks, skill checks, and
events.
Cylon Attack Crises
These Crisis Cards feature an image of Galactica and some
surrounding ships. When resolving a Cylon attack Crisis Card,
simply follow the steps listed on it. Then discard the card unless
instructed to keep the card in play.
A Cylon Attack Crisis Card
Skill Check Crises
These Crisis Cards list a difficulty and one or more skill types,
listed as colored boxes, in the upper left corner. These cards
are resolved according to the rules for skill checks (see "Skill
Checks" on page 16) and have outcomes based on whether
the players pass or fail the skill check. Some of these cards
give the current player, the President, or the Admiral the
choice to either resolve the skill check or carry out some
alternate instruction.
A Skill Check Crisis Card
Battlestar Galactica 11
Event Crises
Any Crisis Card that is not a Cylon attack or skill check is an
event. These crises have instructions that must be immediately
followed. Some of them provide a decision for the current
player, the President, or the Admiral.
An Event Crisis Card
Activate Cylon Ships Step
If there is at least one Cylon ship in play, then the Cylon ships
may move or attack based on the icon on the bottom left of
the Crisis Card (see "Activating Cylon Ships" on page 22).
The Bottom of a Crisis Card
Prepare for Jump Step
If the drawn Crisis Card has the "prepare for jump" icon
on its lower right corner, then the fleet token moves one
space ahead (toward the "Auto Jump" space) on the Jump
Preparation track. If this causes the token to move to the
"Auto Jump" space, then the fleet jumps to a new destination
(see "Jumping the Fleet" on page 13).
Prepare for Jump Icon
After this step, the current player's turn is over. He discards
any Crisis Cards drawn this turn, and hands the current
player token to the player on his left, who begins his turn
(starting with the Receive Skills step).
Core Rules
This section explains the core components and rules of the
game. In particular, this section focuses on the human players
and describes characters, jumping the fleet, and skills.
Characters
Each player takes on the role of a character from the Battlestar
Galactica universe. Each character has different
strengths and weaknesses as listed on his character sheet.
The following information can be found on each character
sheet.
 Character Type: Each character has a type listed on his
character sheet. This type only matters during setup,
and exists to help players choose a well-rounded group of
characters.
 Character Abilities: Each character has two positive
abilities and one negative ability. Some of these abilities
are passive (always affecting the character) while others
require the player to use them as an action (see "Action
Step" on page 10).
Losing Resources
The four resources (fuel, food, morale, and population)
are all vital to the survival of humanity. These resources
are usually lost due to Crisis Cards, civilian ships being
destroyed, or Galactica damage tokens.
Crisis cards list resource loss as text, for example "1
population," while tokens list resource loss as a number
of red icons. For example, one red population icon means
the same as "1 population." The list of resource icons is
found below as well as on the game board.
Whenever a resource is lost for any reason, the appropriate
resource dial is adjusted to represent the new total.
The red color on the resource wheels tells players when
a resource is half (or less) full, and is used by sympathizer
Loyalty Cards (see page 18).
Battlestar Galactica
Skill Set: Each character sheet lists the skills the
character has expertise in. At the start of the player's
turn, he gains the number and types of Skill Cards listed
in his character's skill set. When a character is allowed to
draw Skill Cards of an unspecified type, they must be from
within his skill set unless specified otherwise.
Example: William Adama is in the "Research Lab" and
uses the action listed there to draw one tactics or one
engineering card. He may choose to draw engineering
even though it is outside his skill set, because the location
specifies the card type.
 Setup: Each character has setup instructions on his
card. This usually lists the location where the character
is placed at the beginning of the game. Some characters
have special instructions (such as "Apollo," whose sheet
instructs the player to launch a viper and place him in it as
a pilot).
Each character is represented by a stand-up character token,
which is used to track his location on the game board. After
the character tokens are punched out, each one is attached
to a plastic character stand.
Title Cards:
Title and Quorum Cards provide powerful abilities to the
player who controls them. Title Cards are assigned at the
beginning of the game, but may change hands through the
use of certain locations or because of cetain Crisis Cards. In
addition to the abilities listed below, the President and Admiral
are given many important decisions to make by Crisis Cards.
The President and Quorum Cards
The President starts the game with one Quorum Card in
his hand and can draw more using the President Title Card,
or "President's Office" location. These cards provide special
actions that only the President can perform and provide him
a wide range of powerful abilities.
Whichever player has the President title has control over
this hand of Quorum Cards. These cards are kept secret, and
there is no limit to the number of cards that may be in the
President's hand.
The Admiral:
The Admiral has two important abilities. First off, he
starts the game with two nuke tokens. These tokens can
be devastatingly effective against basestars, but are an
extremely limited resource.
Second, the Admiral is the player who decides which
destination the fleet travels to when jumping (see "Jumping
the Fleet" on the following page). This decision can be
extremely beneficial or harmful to the human players.
Human Objective:
For the human players to win the game, they must successfully
jump the fleet enough times to reach Kobol. Once the fleet
has reached Kobol, the humans immediately win the game.
For information on the Cylon players' objective, see "Cylon
Objective" on page 18.
The fleet jumps to a new location in one of two ways.
1. The fleet token is moved to the "Auto Jump" space of the
Jump Preparation track (see "Prepare for Jump Step" on
page 11).
2. A player activates the "FTL Control" location. If the fleet
jumps this way, then some population may be lost (see "FTL
Control Jump" on the following page).

Jumping the Fleet
In Battlestar Galactica, moving ships at faster-than-light
(FTL) speed is referred to as "jumping." Whenever the fleet
jumps, the Admiral draws Destination Cards to determine
where the fleet jumps to. To choose the destination, the
Admiral performs the following steps:
1. Remove Ships: Remove all ships from the game board
(see "Jumping During Combat" on page 25).
2. Choose Destination: The Admiral draws two cards from
the Destination deck, chooses one, and places the other
on the bottom of the deck.
3. Follow Instructions: The Admiral places the chosen card
faceup next to the Kobol Objective Card and follows any
instructions on the Destination Card.
4. Kobol Instructions: If the previous step causes the total
distance on Destination Cards placed adjacent to the
Kobol Objective Card to equal or exceed four or eight for
the first time, then follow the instructions on the Kobol
Objective Card (see page 14).
5. Reset Jump Preparation Track: Move the fleet token to
the start space of the Jump Preparation track.
FTL Control Jump
If the fleet marker has moved to one of the blue spaces of
the Jump Preparation track, players may force the fleet to
jump using the "FTL Control" location. If the fleet jumps due to
someone activating this location, there is a chance that the
fleet will lose some population.
The current player rolls the die, and if a "6" or lower is rolled,
then a number of population is lost equal to the number listed
on the current space of the Jump Preparation track. Players
then follow all steps for "Jumping the Fleet" on this page.
Example: The fleet token is on the second-to-last space of the
Jump Preparation track (the 1 population space). The current
player activates the "FTL Control" location to jump the
fleet. He rolls a die, and it is a "5" (which is "6" or less), so the
fleet loses 1 population.
Destination Cards
Each Destination Card has two important pieces of
information on it. In the center of the card are the special
effects of traveling to this destination. These effects usually
include losing fuel or other resources and/or following
special instructions. The effects of a Destination Card are
immediately followed when the fleet travels to that destination.
The bottom of each Destination Card lists a distance number.
After the special effects of the card are followed, it is placed
faceup next to the Kobol Objective Card, so that the total
distance the fleet has traveled can easily be seen.
Distance on Destination Cards
Using Abilities
Character sheets, Skill Cards, Loyalty Cards, and Quorum
Cards can all provide abilities to players. Many abilities
are prefaced with the word "Action" followed by a colon,
which means that the character may only use it as his
action during his Action step.
All other abilities do not require an action, and are used
when specified. If multiple players wish to use an ability at
the same time, the current player decides the order.
Example: An unmanned viper has just been attacked by a
raider and an "8" is rolled. Starbuck plays an "Evasive Maneuvers"
piloting card, which allows her to reroll the die.
14 Battlestar Galactica
Kobol Objective Card
The Kobol Objective Card lists important information,
including when additional Loyalty Cards are dealt out and
how the human players can win the game. When the fleet
equals or exceeds a listed distance total for the first time, the
players perform the following instructions. These instructions
are also summarized on the Kobol Objective Card.
 Sleeper Agents: When four or more units of distance
have been traveled, the remaining Loyalty Cards are dealt
out (see "Sleeper Agents Phase" on page 18).
 Reach Kobol: After eight or more units of distance have
been traveled, the humans are only one jump away from
winning the game. The next time the humans jump, they do
not draw a Destination Card; instead, they simply win the
game (as long as every resource is higher than 0).
Example: The human players have 1 population resource
remaining and have traveled 8 units of distance. William
Adama uses the "FTL Control" location to jump the fleet.
The humans will win the game due to this jump, as long as
they do not lose any population due to the "FTL Control"
location.
Example of Jumping
1. During the Prepare for Jump step, the current Crisis
Card has the prepare for jump icon. The fleet marker is
moved one space ahead on the Jump Preparation track.
Since this causes the token to enter the Auto Jump
space, the fleet jumps. All ships are removed from the
game board.
2. The Admiral draws the top two cards of the Destination
deck and chooses one to play faceup. The other card is
returned to the bottom of the deck.
3. The chosen card is placed faceup next to the Kobol
Objective Card. The instructions on the Destination Card
are then followed (in this case, to lose 1 fuel and destroy
1 raptor).
4. If this had caused the total distance to equal or
exceed four (or eight) units for the first time, then the
instructions on the Kobol Card would be followed. In this
example, nothing happens since neither of these totals
was exceeded for the first time.
5. The fleet token is moved back to the start of the Jump
Preparation track.

Skill Cards
At the start of each player's turn, he draws the number and
types of Skill Cards indicated by his skill set (listed on his
character sheet). These are always drawn regardless of how
many cards are already in his hand. These cards are used
to overcome skill checks or to provide players with special
actions (and other abilities) that they can perform. Each skill
type specializes in different strategies:
Politics: This skill represents a character's ability to
control morale and help the fleet overcome crises. This
is the most common skill type required by Crisis Cards.
Some politics cards also provide the ability to allow a
player draw Skill Cards from outside his skill set.
Leadership: This skill represents a character's ability to
take charge of situations and command other individuals.
This is the second-most common skill type required by
Crisis Cards. Some leadership cards allow players to move
other characters and grant them a bonus action.
Tactics: This skill type represents a character's ability to
plan missions as well as to physically overcome obstacles.
Tactics cards allow players to gain bonuses to die rolls as
well as scout the galaxy for new destinations.
Piloting: This skill represents a character's ability to fly
vipers. Piloting cards allow players to reroll enemy attack
rolls as well as gain additional attacks.
Engineering: This skill represents a character's strength
in the mechanical and scientific fields. Some engineering
cards allow players to repair vipers and locations aboard
Galactica.

If a player has more than 10 Skill Cards in his hand at the end
of any player's turn, he must discard cards (of his choice) until
he has only 10. This hand limit does not include other cards,
such as Quorum Cards or Super Crisis Cards that may be in a
player's hand.
Whenever a player discards a Skill Card, it is placed in a
discard pile faceup next to the appropriate Skill deck. When
a deck runs out of Skill Cards, the discard pile is shuffled to
create a new Skill deck.
Destiny Deck
At the start of the game, a deck of 10 Skill Cards (two of each
type) is created and shuffled. Two random cards from this
deck are placed into each skill check, and add an element of
uncertainty.
After the last card from the Destiny deck is played, the
current player creates a new one by dealing out two cards of
each skill type. He then shuffles those cards thoroughly and
places them on the appropriate space on the game board.

Skill Checks
Many Crisis Cards and game board locations require skill
checks. Skill checks represent struggles and challenges that
require particular skill types to overcome. They are always
represented by a difficulty number (listed first) followed by
the necessary skill types (colored boxes). All skill checks are
resolved as follows:
1. Read Card: The current player reads the entire card (or
location) out loud to all players. Players may then discuss
what they would like to do (following the guidelines under
"Secrecy Rules" on page 20). If the card requires the current
player, the President, or the Admiral to make a choice,
he must make the decision at this time. Any choice that
does not have a pass/fail effect requires players to carry
out specific instructions instead of a making a skill check.
2. Play from Destiny Deck: Two cards from the Destiny deck
are dealt facedown together, starting a common pile. This
pile can be placed on the Battlestar Galactica logo of the
game board, or any common area that is in reach of all
players.
3. Play Skills: Starting with the player that is to the left of
the current player (and ending with the current player),
each player may play any number of Skill Cards from
his hand facedown to the common pile. Any text on the
Skill Cards played onto the pile in this manner is ignored.
Only the strength and types of skills on each Skill Card is
relevant when played into a skill check.
4. Shuffle and Divide Cards: After each player has had one
opportunity to play Skill Cards, the current player takes
all Skill Cards from the pile and shuffles them. (The cards
are shuffled so none of the players will know which players
contributed which cards to the pile.) He then deals them
faceup into two new piles. All cards that match a skill type
(color) listed on the Crisis Card are placed in one pile, and
all other cards (i.e., those that do not match) are placed in
the other pile.
5. Total Strength: The total strength (upper left number) of
each card pile is totaled. The total strength of the nonmatching
pile is subtracted from the total strength of the
matching pile, giving a final strength.
6. Determine Result: If the final strength is equal to or
greater than the skill check's difficulty, then the "pass"
result of the skill check is carried out. Otherwise, the "fail"
result is followed. All Skill Cards contributed toward the
skill check are then discarded into the appropriate discard
piles.
Partial Passes
Some skill checks have a partial pass number listed between
the "pass" and "fail" results. If the skill check is not passed,
but this partial pass number is equaled or exceeded, then this
result is followed (instead of the "pass" or "fail" results).
A Crisis Card with a Partial Pass Result
Skill Supervisor
Although it is technically the current player's responsibility
to make sure that Skill Cards are discarded properly,
many play groups prefer to assign one player the role of
SKILL SUPERVISOR at the start of the game.
This player is in charge of sorting discarded Skill Cards
into the appropriate discard piles. In addition, when a Skill
deck runs out, this player is responsible for reshuffling
the appropriate discard pile to form a new deck. Lastly,
when the Destiny deck runs out, this player is in charge
of creating a new Destiny deck (by collecting two of each
Skill Card type and then shuffling them together).

Example of a Skill Check
During his Crisis step, t 1. he current player draws the
"Fulfiller of Prophecy" Crisis Card. He reads it aloud and
must choose whether to perform a skill check (the top
option) or resolve the bottom section. He chooses the
top option, and will therefore resolve a skill check.
2. Two cards from the Destiny deck are dealt into a
common pile.
3. The player to the current player's left plays two Skill
Cards into the pile. The next player decides not to play
any cards, and finally, the current player plays a single
card.
4. The current player shuffles the pile of cards and divides
them into two new piles. Cards that match the skill
types on the Crisis Card are placed in one pile, and nonmatching
cards are placed in the other.
5. Both piles are individually totaled. The non-matching pile
total of "3" is then subtracted from the matching pile of
total "6," providing a final strength of "3."
6. Since the final strength did not equal or exceed the difficulty
of the skill check, the "fail" result is performed. The
fleet loses 1 population, and the current player adjusts
the population resource dial (from 12 to 11).

Game Board Skill Checks:
Three game board locations  "Administration," "Admiral's
Quarters," and the "Brig,"  instruct the player using the
location to carry out a skill check. In these cases, a skill check
is resolved (following the rules on page 16). The specific rules
for skill checks at these locations are found below:
Administration: The current player
chooses any player to nominate for
the presidency. A 5 difficulty politics/
leadership skill check is resolved with
the following results.
Pass: The nominated player claims
the President title.
Fail: No Effect.
Admiral's Quarters: The current
player chooses any character to
accuse. A 7 difficulty leadership/
tactics skill check is resolved with the
following results.
Pass: The accused character is
moved to the "Brig."
Fail: No Effect.
Brig: The current player attempts
to escape the "Brig" location. A 7
difficulty politics/tactics skill check is
resolved with the following results.
Pass: The current player may
move his character to any space on
Galactica.
Fail: No Effect.
Cylon Players
In each game, there will be at least one Cylon player working
against the humans. The number of Cylon players varies
based upon the number of people playing the game.
Cylon Objective
For the Cylon players to win the game, they must prevent the
humans from completing the Kobol Objective. There are three
possible ways of doing this:
Run Out a Resource: If at least one resource is depleted
to 0 or less at the end of a player's turn, the game
immediately ends and the Cylon players win. This is the
most common way the Cylons to win. Note that it is
possible for the human players to reach 0 of a resource
type and then increase it during the same turn without
losing the game.
Centurion Invasion: If at least one centurion marker
reaches the end of the Boarding Party track, then the
crew of the Galactica are killed and the Cylon players win
(see "Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions" on page 24).
 Galactica Destroyed: If six or more locations on Galactica
have damage tokens on them at the same time, then
Galactica is destroyed and the Cylon players win (see
"Damage Tokens" on page 25).
Loyalty Cards
Each player starts the game with one Loyalty Card. Later
in the game, players receive additional Loyalty Cards (see
"Sleeper Agent Phase" on page 19), which increase their
chances of being Cylon players.
Loyalty Cards are kept facedown, but their owners may look
at them at any time. A player may not look at other players'
Loyalty Cards unless specifically allowed to do so by a card
or ability. When a player is allowed to look at a single Loyalty
Card belonging to a player who has more than one, the card
viewed is selected randomly.
Each Loyalty Card specifies whether the controlling player is
a Cylon, is not a Cylon, or is a Sympathizer (see "Sympathizer"
on page 19).
Important: If a player has at least one "You are a Cylon" card,
then he is a Cylon player and ignores all "You are not a Cylon"
cards that he may have.
Sleeper Agent Phase
Once the fleet has traveled at least four distance, each
player (including revealed Cylon players) is dealt one card
from the top of the Loyalty deck. If a player receives a "You
are a Sympathizer" card, then he must immediately reveal
and resolve it. If he is a revealed Cylon player, then he may
first give the card to any other player (who then immediately
resolves it).
Sympathizer
In addition to human and Cylon players, there may be a
Sympathizer inside the fleet. The "You Are a Sympathizer"
card represents a human or Cylon who wishes to side with
the other team, and is only used in a four or six player game.
This card is not added to the Loyalty deck until after the initial
Loyalty Cards have been dealt out.
A player who receives this card must immediately reveal it. If
at least 1 resource is half full or lower (in the red zone), then
the player is moved to the "Brig" location. This card is then
treated as a "You Are Not a Cylon" card.
If every resource is more than half full (not in the red zone),
then this player becomes a revealed Cylon player for the
remainder of the game and follows the game turn steps
described under "Revealed Cylon Players" on this page (except
for steps "4" and "5.") This player may never activate the
"Cylon Fleet" location or play Super Crisis Cards.
The Sympathizer Loyalty Card
Revealed Cylon Players
A player who has a "You are a Cylon" Loyalty Card may reveal
it as an action. After a player has revealed himself as a Cylon,
he performs the following steps:
1. Discard: The player discards down to three Skill Cards.
2. Lose Titles: If the player had any Title Cards, they are given
to a different player (see "Line of Succession" on page 28).
3. Resurrect: The player moves his character token to the
"Resurrection Ship" Cylon location.
4. Receive Super Crisis: The player receives one random
Super Crisis Card. This card remains in his hand and may
be played by activating the "Caprica" Cylon location. Super
Crisis Cards are treated like normal Crisis Cards, but are
immune to all character abilities that affect Crisis Cards.
5. End Turn: The player's turn then ends, and the current
player token is passed to the player on his left. Note that
a player who reveals himself as a Cylon does not draw
a Crisis Card at the end of this turn, or any of his future
turns (see "Revealed Cylon Players' Turns," below).
Determining if You Are a Cylon
Carl "Helo" Agathon has two Loyalty Cards, one "You Are
a Cylon" card and one "You Are Not a Cylon" card. Since
he has at least one "You are a Cylon" card, he is a Cylon
player. He may reveal himself on his turn (as an action) to
perform the special ability listed on his Loyalty Card. If he
does so, he becomes a revealed Cylon player (see below).
Revealed Cylon Players' Turns
On a revealed Cylon player's turn, he does not receive Skill
Cards based on his skill set or draw Crisis Cards. He simply
draws 2 cards, moves to any Cylon location, and then may use
the action on it.
1. Draw Skills Step: The Cylon player may draw two Skill
Cards of any type(s).
2. Movement Step: The Cylon player may move to any other
Cylon location.
3. Action Step: The Cylon player may perform the action
listed on his current location. Revealed Cylons may not
perform other actions, such as those found on Skill Cards
or Quorum Cards. All of the abilities listed on a revealed
Cylon player's character sheet are also ignored.
Important Note: There are no "Activate Cylon Ship" and
"Prepare for Jump" steps during a revealed Cylon player's turn.
Revealed Cylons and Crises
Although revealed Cylon players do not automatically draw
a Crisis Card on their turn, they may draw and play a Crisis
Card by using the "Caprica" Cylon location. When a revealed
Cylon player draws a Crisis Card that poses a choice for the
current player, that player makes the decision.
Revealed Cylon players are unaffected by abilities on Crisis
Cards and skill checks. They cannot be sent to the "Brig" or
"Sickbay" locations, and cannot be forced to discard Skill Cards.
Revealed Cylon Players' Skill Cards
Revealed Cylon players only draw two Skill Cards on their
turns. A revealed Cylon player may  at his option  play one
(and only one) Skill Card into each skill check that is resolved.
Revealed Cylon players may not use actions or abilities listed
on Skill Cards. They must continue to obey the hand limit rule,
and discard down to 10 Skill Cards at the end of each player's
turn.
The Destiny deck is still used after a Cylon player has been
revealed.
Secrecy
A key element of Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game
is the paranoia and tension surrounding the hidden Cylon
players. Because of this, secrecy is very important, and
the following rules must be observed at all times:
 Blind Accusations: Players may accuse each other
of being Cylon operatives at any time. Although these
blind accusations have no game rule effects, they can
help, or confuse, the human players in their hunt to
find the Cylons.
 Open Accusations: Should one player gain the ability
to look at another player's Loyalty Cards, he may
choose to keep this information to himself, share it
with the group, or even lie about it.
 Skill Cards and Skill Checks: Players are prohibited
from revealing the exact strength of cards in their
hands. They may use vague terms such as "I can help
out on this crisis a little bit," but they may not make
more specific statements such as "I am playing 5
piloting." In addition, after a skill check is resolved,
players may not identify which cards they played.
The reason for these restrictions is to keep hidden
information secret and to protect Cylon players from
being discovered too easily.
 Cards in the Decks: If a player has the ability to look
at cards on the top of a deck, he may not disclose
specific information about that card.
 Revealed Cylons: Revealed Cylon players must also
follow all rules of secrecy. They may not show their
hands to other players and may not say which Super
Crisis Card they have in their hands.
Battlestar Galactica 21
Ship Reference
Galactica
This large ship leads and
defends the human fleet,
and is depicted in the
center of the game board.
There are many locations
on Galactica where
characters can take
different actions.
Colonial One
This ship, smaller than
Galactica, is the President's
base of operations and is
depicted at the top of the
game board. There are several
locations on Colonial One where
characters can take different actions.
Vipers
These plastic ships are used by the
humans to defend their fleet and to
attack Cylon ships. Vipers are placed
in the "Reserves," "Damaged Vipers,"
or space areas of the game board.
Raptors
These plastic ships are used by the
humans to scout for new destinations,
as well as to attempt to find more
resources (such as fuel and food). These
ships are never used in combat and
remain in the "Reserves" until destroyed.
Civilian Ships
These small tokens represent
unarmed human ships.
When one of these ships is
destroyed, the resources
(usually population) listed on
the face of the token are lost.
These ships are always kept
facedown.
Basestars
These large Cylon ships are
represented by large punchboard
tokens. These ships are often
placed in different space areas
and can both attack Galactica
directly and launch raiders and
heavy raiders.
Raiders
These plastic ships are used by the
Cylons to attack the fleet. These fragile
ships are plentiful, and often attack
vipers and civilian ships.
Heavy Raiders
These plastic ships are used by the
Cylons to land boarding parties on
Galactica. These ships never attack
other ships; their sole purpose is to
reach the hangar deck and release
their deadly centurion boarding parties.

COMBAT:
As long as there is at least one Cylon ship on the game board,
the fleet is considered to be in combat. Cylon ships are
activated at the end of each turn, based upon the Crisis Card
drawn. This section describes the details of combat, including
how to activate, attack, and pilot ships.
Cylon Attack Cards
When a Cylon attack Crisis Card is drawn, the following steps
are performed as listed on the card:
1. Activate Existing Cylon Ships: Any existing Cylon ships
are activated based upon the icon(s) listed on the card. If
there are multiple icons listed, they are activated from left
to right, following standard activation rules (see "Activating
Cylon Ships" below).
2. Setup: Place new Cylon ships, vipers, and civilian ships
on the game board as illustrated on the card. Vipers are
always placed from the "Reserves" and civilian ships are
always drawn randomly from among those in the stockpile
and are placed on the game board facedown.
3. Special Rules: Most Cylon attack Crisis Cards have a
special rule on them, which is followed at this time.
A Cylon attack card is discarded once these three steps have
been carried out, unless the card specifies "Keep this card in
play," in which case it has an ongoing ability that usually lasts
until the fleet jumps.
Activating Cylon Ships
While in combat, the Cylon ships are activated after the
Resolve Crisis step of each player's turn. Activating a ship
causes it to either move or attack. Cylon ships are always
activated according to the rules below, even if there is a
revealed Cylon player.
If multiple space areas contain ships that need to be
activated, the ships are activated one entire space area at
a time in the order of the current player's choice. Each Cylon
ship can only be activated once on a given player's turn.
Activate Raiders
Activate Raiders Icon
When activated, each Cylon raider carries out only one of the
actions listed below, taking only the first action that it is able
to perform (in numerical priority, with "Attack a Viper" taking
the highest priority and "Attack Galactica" taking the lowest).
1. Attack a Viper: The raider attacks a viper in its space
area. It attacks an unmanned viper if able; otherwise it attacks
a piloted viper.
2. Destroy Civilian Ship: If there are no vipers in its area, the
raider destroys one civilian ship in its area. The current
player chooses a civilian ship in the area and flips it over.
The resources listed on its face are lost, and the token is
removed from the game.
3. Move: If there are no civilian ships in the area, the viper
moves one space area towards the nearest civilian ship. If
several civilian ships are equidistant, it moves clockwise
around Galactica.
4. Attack Galactica: If there are no civilian ships on the game
board, the raider attacks Galactica (see "Attacking" on
page 24).
If there are no raiders on the game board when raiders are
activated, two raiders are launched from each basestar. If
there are no basestars in play, then nothing happens.
Example: The current Crisis Card has been resolved and has the
activate raider icon on it. All Cylon raiders on the game board
(they are all in the same area) are activated. The first raider
attacks a viper in its area and destroys it. As a result, there
are no vipers or civilian ships in the second raider's area, so it
moves to an adjacent space (towards the nearest civilian ship).
Launch Raiders
Launch Raiders Icon
When the launch raiders icon appears, each basestar
launches three raiders. If there are no basestars in play, then
nothing happens.
Whenever a raider (or heavy raider) is launched, the current
player takes a ship of the specified type from among those
not currently on the game board. He then places it in the
launching basestar's area. If all of the raiders are on the game
board, then no more raiders may be launched.

Activating Cylon Raiders
During the Activate Cylon Ship 1. s step, the current Crisis
Card has the activate raiders icon. There are multiple
raiders on the board, so the current player chooses an
area and activates the raiders in that area (one at a
time).
2. The first raider attacks a viper in its area, rolls a "5," and
damages the viper.
3. The other raider in the area does not have any vipers
to attack, so it destroys a civilian ship in its area. The
civilian ship token is turned over, and the resources on
its face (2 population) are lost.
4. The next area to be activated has a single raider in it.
Since there are no ships in its area, the ship moves
towards the nearest civilian ship (clockwise). The next
time the raider is activated, it will most likely destroy
the civilian ship in its area.

Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions
Activate Heavy Raiders and Centurions Icon
Heavy raiders never attack. They always move towards the
nearest space area containing a viper launch icon. If a heavy
raider starts its movement in a space with a viper launch
icon, the centurions on it board Galactica.
A Viper Launch Icon
When centurions from a heavy raider board Galactica,
that heavy raider is removed from the game board, and a
centurion token is placed on the start space of the Boarding
Party track. Whenever there are any centurion tokens on the
Boarding Party track and heavy raiders are activated (even
by a revealed Cylon player), each centurion token moves one
space towards the "Humans Lose" space. If a centurion token
reaches the end of the track, then the Cylons win the game.
The Boarding Party Track
The human players can attempt to destroy centurions by
activating the "Armory" location on the game board.
If there are no heavy raiders on the game board when heavy
raiders are activated, one heavy raider is launched from
each basestar. If there are no basestars in play, then nothing
happens.
Activate Cylon Basestars
Activate Basestars Icon
When a Cylon basestar is activated, the basestar attacks
Galactica. The current player rolls a die for each basestar on
the game board to find out if the attack damages Galactica
(see "Attacking," on this page).
Attacking
Whenever a ship attacks, the current player rolls an eight-sided
die and consults the entry on the table that corresponds
to the target of the attack (and, sometimes, the method of
the attack). Depending upon the rolled result, the target can
become damaged or be destroyed.
Note that players may never attack human ships with vipers
or with the "Weapon's Control" location.
Damage, Destruction, and Remove from Game
Depending upon the ship type, different things happen if a ship
is damaged or destroyed.
When a Cylon ship is destroyed, it is removed from the game
board, but may return later in the game.
When a viper is damaged, it is placed in the "Damaged
Viper" box of the game board. A viper in this box may not be
launched or used until it has been repaired (usually by an
engineering card).
When a viper or raptor is destroyed, it is removed from the game.
When a civilian ship is destroyed, it is turned faceup. The fleet
then loses the resources (usually population) listed on the
token. The token is then removed from the game.
Attack Table
UNIT ATTACKED DIE RESULT
38 = Destroyed

the same area.
Battlestar Galactica 25
Whenever a ship (or other component) is removed from the
game, it is placed in the game box and may not be used for
the remainder of the game.
Damage Tokens
Galactica Damage Token Basestar Damage Token
When a basestar or Galactica is damaged, the current player
draws a random damage token of the appropriate ship type.
Their effects vary depending on the token type.
 Damage Location: When drawn, this
token is placed on the matching location
on Galactica. All characters in this location
are moved to "Sickbay." Characters may
move into a damaged location, but may not
use the action listed on it (until repaired
by an engineering card). When a damaged
location is repaired, return the damage
token to the pile of unused damage tokens
and randomize them
 Lost Resource: When drawn, the fleet
loses the listed resources. This token is
then removed from the game.
 Critical Hit: When drawn, this token is
placed on the basestar. While it remains, it
counts as two damage tokens (it takes three
damage tokens to destroy a basestar).
 Disabled Hanger: When drawn, this token is
placed on the basestar. While it remains, the
basestar may not launch raiders or heavy
raiders.
 Disabled Weapons: When drawn, this token
is placed on the basestar. While it remains,
the basestar may not attack Galactica.
 Structural Damage: When drawn, this
token is placed on the basestar. While it
remains, all attacks against the basestar
gain +2 to their die rolls.
If a basestar receives three or more damage tokens, then it is
destroyed and is removed from the game board. All damage
tokens on it are returned and randomly mixed into the pile of
unused damage tokens.
If six or more areas on Galactica have damage tokens at the
same time, then the Cylon players win the game.
Jumping During Combat
When the fleet jumps during combat, all ships are removed
from the space areas of the game board. Any vipers so
removed are returned to the "Reserves," and any civilian ships
so removed are shuffled back into the pile of unused civilian
ships. Any character who was piloting a viper is moved to the
"Hangar Deck" location.
Any centurion tokens on the Boarding Party track remain in
play when the fleet jumps.
Activating Vipers
Although Galactica does have mounted weaponry, its real
military strength lies in its squadrons of single-man fighters
known as vipers. The main purpose of vipers is to defend the
fleet, particularly civilian ships, from Cylon ships. Vipers are
usually activated by using the "Command" location.
When a player activates a viper, he must choose one of the
following options:
 Launch a Viper: The player takes a viper from the
"Reserves" and places it in one of the two space areas
marked with the viper launch icon (see page 24).
 Move a Viper: The player chooses a viper that is already in
a space area. He may move the viper to an adjacent space
area. Note that vipers may not fly "over" Galactica; they
may only move clockwise or counterclockwise "around" it,
between directly adjacent space areas.
 Attack with a Viper: The player chooses a viper and a
Cylon ship that are in the same space area. He then rolls
one eight-sided die to resolve an attack following the rules
under "Attacking" on page 24.
Each viper may be activated any number of times during a
player's turn, but players may not activate ships that are
being piloted by another player. Vipers without piloting tokens
under them are referred to as unmanned vipers.
26 Battlestar Galactica
Piloting Vipers
All characters who have piloting in their skill set have the
ability to personally pilot a viper. A piloted viper functions
slightly differently than an unmanned viper and may not be
activated using the "Command" location.
A player who wants his character to pilot a viper simply
moves his character to the "Hangar Deck" location and uses
the action listed there. He then launches a viper as normal
(see the previous section), places his piloting token beneath it,
and removes his character token from the game board, placing
it on his character sheet.
Moving and Actions when Piloting
While a character is piloting a viper, his player still takes his
turn as normal. During his Movement step, he may move the
viper to an adjacent space area or move his character back
to a location (see "Moving From a Viper" below).
In addition to the normal things that a player may do during
his Action step (for example, play a Skill Card), he may also
choose to activate his viper (to move again or attack).
Viper Destruction
If a character is piloting a viper when it is damaged or
destroyed, his character token is placed in "Sickbay," and
the viper is placed in the appropriate space (the "Damaged
Vipers" area or back in the game box.)
Moving from a Viper
When the fleet jumps, all characters who were piloting vipers
are placed in the "Hangar Deck," and their vipers are returned
to the "Reserves."
A player may also choose to move to Galactica or Colonial
One from a viper during his Movement step. In order to do
this, he must discard one Skill Card, and then he simply places
his viper in the "Reserves" and his character token on the
location of his choice. He may do this from any space area.
If a player is sent to "Sickbay" or the "Brig" while piloting a
viper, he is moved to the appropriate location, and his viper is
returned to the "Reserves."
Whenever a character moves from piloting a viper to a
location, his piloting token is removed from the game board.
Raptors and Risking
Raptors are not used during combat and are usually "risked"
according to the instructions on Skill and Destination Cards
to receive particular rewards. In order to risk a ship, there
must be at least one of the required type of ship in the
"Reserves." These cards usually instruct the player to roll a
die and receive a reward if he reaches a specified number.
If the die roll is less than the number, then the risked ships
listed on the card are destroyed, and no reward is gained.
A "Launch Scout" Skill Card
Example: The current player plays the "Launch Scout"
tactics card as an action. The card specifies that he may
risk a raptor to look at the top card of the Destination or
Crisis deck. Because there is at least one raptor in the
"Reserves," the player is able to take this action. He rolls a die
as instructed, and rolls a "1." Since this does not reach the
target number of 3, he does not gain the reward and a raptor
is destroyed.
Battlestar Galactica 27
Piloting a Viper and Attacking
"Starbuck" uses the action 1. in the "Hangar Deck" location
to launch herself in a viper. She removes her character
token from the board, launches a viper, and places her
piloting token under it.
2. She may then take another action (as specified on the
"Hangar Deck" location). She decides to use the action to
activate her viper and attack a raider in her area.
3. She rolls a "3," which is exactly enough to destroy the
raider. It is removed from the game board, and she
proceeds to her Crisis Step.
Note that Starbuck may not use her character's "Expert
Pilot" ability (found on her character sheet) in this example
because she was not piloting a viper at the start of her turn.

OTHER RULES:
Detailed in this section are miscellaneous rules, including
the line of succession for the Admiral and President titles,
the way component limitations affect gameplay, and ways to
adjust the game to make it less difficult for either the humans
or Cylons.
Line of Succession
Should the President or Admiral be revealed as a Cylon, the
next player in the line of succession for that title claims it. In
addition, if the Admiral (but not the President) is placed in the
"Brig," then the next player in line claims the Admiral title. If an
Admiral stripped of his title later moves out of the "Brig," he
does not automatically reclaim the title.
The orders of succession are:
Admiral
1. William Adama
2. Saul Tigh
3. Helo Agathon
4. Lee "Apollo" Adama
5. Kara "Starbuck" Thrace
6. Sharon "Boomer" Valerii
7. Galen Tyrol
8. Tom Zarek
9. Gaius Baltar
10. Laura Roslin
President
1. Laura Roslin
2. Gaius Baltar
3. Tom Zarek
4. Lee "Apollo" Adama
5. William Adama
6. Karl "Helo" Agathon
7. Galen Tyrol
8. Sharon "Boomer" Valerii
9. Saul Tigh
10. Kara "Starbuck" Thrace
Note that if the President is in the "Brig," he keeps the President
title and all associated abilities.
Component Limitations
Whenever a deck of cards runs out, the current player
shuffles the appropriate discard pile to form a new deck. This
includes Skill Cards, Quorum Cards, Crisis Cards, Super Crisis
Cards, and Destination Cards.
Tokens and plastic ships are limited to the quantity provided,
and can run out during the game. The current player always
decides the order in which a component type is placed, and if
there are not enough, he decides which ones are not placed.
Example: A Cylon attack Crisis Card is drawn that requires
two basestars to be placed on the game board. There is
already one basestar on the game board, so there is only one
more that can be placed. The current player decides which of
the two basestars listed on the Cylon attack card to place on
the game board.
If all vipers are already in play and a player wishes to activate
the "Hangar Deck" location, he may choose to move a viper
from any space area to the "Reserves" so that he may pilot it.
Adjusting Diffi culty
Some play groups may find that it is too easy for the human or
Cylon players to win the game. A group may decide before the
start of the game to make the game easier for the humans or
Cylons.
To make the game easier for the human players, start the
game with 2 more of each resource (10 food, 10 fuel, 12
morale, and 14 population).
To make the game easier for the Cylons, start the game with
2 less of each resource.

Human Player Strategy
The ultimate goal for the human players is to conserve
enough resources to travel eight units of distance and then
jump to Kobol. This makes their immediate goal to preserve
resources, and their long-term goal to travel enough distance.
On the Humans' Turns
Two things need to be taken into account during a human
player's turn: first, which resources are in the most danger,
and second, which actions are available to the player.
Each character type has a particular specialization. For
example, pilots are good at piloting vipers and destroying
Cylon ships, while political leaders are good at overcoming
Crisis Cards and using the Quorum deck.
At the start of the game, it is important to make sure that
resources lost are not all of the same type. For example,
morale is most often lost from Crisis Cards, and the loss of
morale can often get out of control. Alternatively, population
is usually safe from Crisis Cards, but in grave danger when
the Cylons attack.
It is also important to be able to determine when to use the
"FTL Control" location. For example, it is often not a good idea
to use "FTL Control" when population is running low.
Dealing with Cylon Players
The biggest threat to the human players is posed by the
Cylons who have infiltrated the fleet. Human players should
try to keep an eye on the negative Skill Cards that come up
during skill checks and should question each decision made
on Crisis Cards. The sooner the humans can get the Cylon
players into the "Brig" location, the better. A Cylon player in
the "Brig" has limited impact on the game, and is less harmful
if he decides to reveal himself.
Preparing for the Sleeper Agent Phase
It is important for human players to keep in mind that even
if they do not start as a Cylon, that may change during the
Sleeper Agent phase. At the start of the game, it may be a
good strategy for the humans to avoid doing too well, because
one of them may become a Cylon player during the Sleeper
Agent phase. Performing exceptionally well as a human
may make winning the game more difficult for a player who
switches over to the Cylon side.
Cylon Player Strategy
The ultimate goal of the Cylon players is to make sure
the humans lose the game, usually by focusing on a single
resource type and running it down to nothing.
While Unrevealed
During skill checks, Cylon players should find any and all
reasons to avoid helping out. When they do help out, they
should make sure to throw in a negative card (or two) to
cancel out their help. However, Cylon players should be careful
not to look too suspicious and should make sure to use
resource types that other players could have thrown in as
well. Often times, the best way to avoid suspicion is to make
other players seem more suspicious.
It is fairly important for Cylon players to avoid being placed in
the "Brig" while unrevealed. While in the "Brig," Cylon players
cannot use the special ability on their Loyalty Cards (but may
still reveal themselves). It is often worthwhile to throw other
players in the "Brig" to avoid suspicion.
A properly timed reveal can be devastating to the humans.
Cylon players should pay attention to the special ability of
their Loyalty Cards and wait for the perfect time to strike.
While Revealed
Revealed Cylons have one main purpose: to focus on the
weakest resource and destroy it. Morale and population are
usually the two easiest resources to decrease. Morale is
easiest to decrease by Crisis Cards (through the "Caprica"
location), while population is easiest to destroy with Cylon
attacks (using the "Cylon Fleet" location).
Revealed Cylon players should usually draw piloting or
engineering Skill Cards on their turn, since these types
appear on Crisis Cards least frequently.

CARD CLARIFICATIONS:
This section clarifies the effects of some cards.
 Resource Maximums: Although resources can sometimes
be increased by cards, they can never be raised higher
than 15.
 "Food Shortage" Crisis Card: This card causes the
President and current player to discard two cards each.
If the President is the current player, then he must
discard four cards.
 Choice Crises: When a player makes a choice on a Crisis
Card, he can always choose the top or bottom section of
the card, regardless of whether he will be able to fulfill the
game text listed (unless the card specifically restricts this).
Frequently Overlooked
Rules
 Players always draw all Skill Cards indicated on their
character sheet at the start of their turn, regardless of
hand size.
 Ships may only move into adjacent space areas. They may
not move over Galactica.
 When a player receives a "You are a Sympathizer" card, he
must immediately reveal it.
 When using the "FTL Control" location, population is lost
according to the Jump Preparation track on a roll of 6 or
less.
 Each player must discard down to 10 Skill Cards at the
end of every player's turn.
 Players may move out of "Sickbay" without difficulty, but
not the "Brig." They may only move out of the "Brig" by
passing the skill check listed on the location.
 Cylon players may only reveal their Loyalty Cards as an
Action.
 Revealed Cylon players are dealt a Loyalty Card during the
Sleeper Agent phase.
 Cylon ships are always activated according to the "Activate
Cylon Ships" rules (page 22), even if there is a revealed
Cylon player.
 Super Crisis Cards are immune to character abilities that
specifically affect Crisis Cards.

Activating Cylon Ships
Raiders: Will take one of the following actions (topmost).
1. Attack a viper in its area (unmanned if able).
2. Destroy a civilian ship in its area (current player's choice).
3. Move towards nearest civilian ship (if tied, move
clockwise).
4. Attack Galactica.
If no Raiders are in play, launch two raiders from each
Basestar.
Heavy Raiders: Never attack and always move towards the
nearest viper launch icon. If activated in a space with a viper
launch icon, their centurions board Galactica (see page 24).
Each time heavy raiders are activated, centurions are also
activated. If there are no heavy raiders in play when a crisis
activates them, instead launch one heavy raider from each
Basestar in play.

GAME NAME:
Castles of Burgundy

DESIGNED BY:
Stefan Feld

The Loire Valley during the 15th Century. As influential princes, the
players devote their efforts to careful trading and building in order to
lead their estates to prominence.
Two dice set out the action options, but the players always make the final
choices. Whether trading or livestock farming, city building or scientific
research, many different paths lead to the prosperity and prominence of the
players!
The many ways to gain victory points in this building game require careful
thought round after round along with extensive planning ahead. Thanks to
the different estates, the game remains challenging for the players for a long
time, as no two games play out alike.
The winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the
game.

GAME COMPONENTS:
- 164 six-sided tiles:
- 7x 8 buildings (beige, 16x with black backs)
- 7x 4 animals (light green, 8x with black backs)
- 26x "knowledge" (yellow, 6x with black backs)
- 16 castles (dark green, 2x with black backs)
- 12 mines (grey, 2x with black backs)
- 26 ships (blue, 6x with black backs)
- 42 goods tiles (square, 7 in each of 6 colours)
- 20 "Silverlings" (eight-sided)
- 30 worker tiles (square)
- 12 bonus tiles (square, 1 small and 1 large in each of 6 colours)
- 4 victory point tiles (with 100 / 200 points in each of the 4 player colours)
- 8 playing pieces (2 in each of the 4 player colours)
- 9 dice (2 in each of the 4 player colours plus 1 white one)
- 1 game board
- 6 player boards (double-sided, 4x No. 1, 1 each of Nos. 2-9)
If you are reading these rules for the first time, then we recommend ignoring the bold text in the right-hand column
of each page. These texts form a summary of the rules to assist in quickly re-learning the game, even after not having
played for a longer time.

OVERVIEW:
Players take on the roles of 15th
Century princes in Burgundy
Over the course of 5 phases of play,
players collect the game-deciding
victory points via trading, livestock
farming, city building or scientific
research
The player with the most victory
points at the end is the winner

The unique building game about pastures, goods and dice
The Castles of Burgundy
(Before playing for the first time, carefully punch all the tiles out of the counter sheets.)
Place the Gameboard in the middle of the table. It
shows:
5 phase spaces (A-E)
5 round spaces
6 numbered depots (1-6) each with
four spaces for six-sided tiles and 1 large
goods space
1 central black depot
12 spaces for the bonus tiles
1 turn order track
1 victory point track (0-100)
Place the 20 Silverlings, the 30 worker tiles as well as the white die next to
the game board.
Sort the 164 six-sided tiles according to the colour of their backs and place
them, as separate face-down supplies, next to the game board.
Shuffle the 42 goods tiles (square tiles) face down. Then separate them into
5 face-down piles, each made up of 5 tiles. Place one pile onto each of the 5
phase spaces lettered A through E on the game board. The remaining 17 tiles
remain in a face-down supply for now.
Place the 12 bonus tiles (square) onto the corresponding spaces on the game
board.
Give each player:
- 1 player board, placed with the Number 1 side face up in front of himself
(for boards with the numbers 2 through 9, see the additional information on
page 12);
- 1 castle (= dark green six-sided tile), to be placed face up onto the dark green
middle space (with the die value 6) of his player board;
- 3 random goods tiles from the remaining 17 tiles, to be placed face up onto
the three goods storage spaces in the upper left hand corner of his board: tiles
of the same goods type (= colour) are stored together, different types are stored
separately;
(any remaining goods tiles are not used in the game and are returned to the box)
- the 2 dice in his colour;
- 1 playing piece in the same colour, to be placed onto the 0/100 space of the
victory point track;
- 1 Silverling, to be placed in the appropriate storage space in the upper left
hand corner of his board, visible to all other players;
- 1 victory point tile (with 100 / 200), to be placed next to his board for
now.

GAME SETUP:
Place the 20 Silverlings, the 30
worker tiles, the 164 six-sided tiles
(sorted according to colour) and the
white die next to the game board
Place 5 piles of 5 face-down goods
tiles onto phase spaces A-E
Place 2 x 6 bonus tiles onto the
corresponding spaces on the game
board
Give each player:
- 1 player board
- 1 "start castle"
- 3 random goods tiles
- 2 same-coloured dice
- 1 playing piece (victory points)
- 1 playing piece (turn order)
- 1 victory point tile
- 1 Silverling
Game Setup
Don't forget
Determine a start player by rolling dice. That player receives one worker tile
which he places onto the appropriate storage space in the lower left hand corner
of his board, visible to all other players. The next player in clockwise direction
receives 2 worker chips, the third player receives 3 and the fourth player
receives 4.
Each player uses their second playing piece to mark the just-determined playing
order on the first space of the turn order track: The start player's piece should be
on top in the tower and the last player's piece should be at the bottom.
Give the start player the white die.
The game lasts for five phases (A through E). Each phase consists of five rounds.
Setup for each phase
At the start of each phase, the following setup is carried out:
- Remove all six-sided tiles remaining on the board and return them to the box
(naturally not required before the first phase).
(Note: Ship, mine and castle tiles can be left in place as they are all the
same! Any remaining goods tiles are also left on the board!)
- Randomly draw new six-sided tiles and place them, face-up, onto the
matching-coloured six-sided spaces in the six numbered depots: In a
2-player game only those spaces marked with 2s (12 spaces), in a 3-player game
only those spaces marked with 2s and 3s (18 spaces), and in a 4-player game all
24 spaces will have tiles placed onto them.
Note: In the three-player game only, there is an exception for the dark green space
in the No. 6 depot: In phases A, C and E a castle is placed onto it as normal, but in
phases B and D a mine (grey) is placed there instead!
Determine a start player and give
each player 1 to 4 worker tiles
depending on play order
Mark turn order on the turn order
track
Give the start player the white die

GAMEPLAY:
At the start of each phase:
- all remaining six-sided tiles are
removed (not in the first phase)
- Goods tiles on the depots' goods
spaces remain
- add new face-up six-sided tiles
from the supply (depending on
number of players)
- place 5 new goods tiles, face-up,
onto the round spaces

- Take the 5 goods tiles for the current phase and place them, face-up, onto the
five square round spaces below the phase spaces.

THE FIVE GAME ROUNDS:
After phase setup, five game rounds follow, each of which is carried out in the
same manner:
First, all players roll their two dice, with the start player also rolling the white
die. Then all players place their dice in front of themselves so that all players
can see them.
Note: Rolling simultaneously allows those players whose turns come later to start
planning their turns ahead of time.
The start player starts. First, he takes the topmost goods tile from the round
spaces and places it onto the goods space of the depot whose number
matches the number rolled on the white die.
With this, the white die's function for this turn is complete; it cannot be
used by the start player to assist him on his own turn (and can never be
adjusted via worker tiles!).
Thereafter, the start player carries his turn out. It is then the turn of the
next player in turn order (moving from right to left on the turn order
track and from top to bottom in a given tower). Once each player has
had a turn, a new round begins, etc.
As 5 goods tiles are added each phase and since one tile is added to a
depot at the start of each round, it is easy to tell which round the current
one is and how long the current phase (and by extension the entire
game) will last.

A PLAYER'S TURN:
... consists of carrying out exactly two actions, one per die. Once a die has
been used, it is placed onto the used die storage space in the upper right hand
corner of the player's board.
Worker tiles: These may be used at any time (a tile, once used, is returned to
the general supply) to adjust a die's result up or down by 1. Changing a die's
result from 1 to 6 or from 6 to 1 is also permitted and also costs one worker
tile. Players may use multiple tiles to change a die's result multiple times.
Example: By paying 2 worker tiles, Anna can turn a 2 into a 6 and
subsequently take a six-sided tile from the No. 6 depot.
All roll simultaneously
Start player places goods tile
according to white die result
Starting with the start player and
then continuing in turn order, each
player uses their dice to carry out
two actions
Each worker tile used can adjust a
die's result by +/- 1 (including from
1 to 6 or vice versa)

THE ACTIONS:
A die is required for each action. The two actions per turn may be carried out in
any combination and order (including carrying the same action out twice).
? Action "Take six-sided tile from the game board"
The player may take one six-sided tile of their choice from the depot
whose number corresponds to the result of the die used to carry out
the action. The chosen tile is placed onto an empty storage space in the bottom
left-hand corner of his board (never directly into his estate!). Should all of
the storage spaces be full, then he must first choose a prior tile to discard (thus
removing it from the game) and subsequently place the new tile onto the newlyemptied
space (players should try to minimize how often they have to discard
tiles).
Action "Add six-sided tile to your estate"
The player may take one six-sided tile of his choice from the storage
area in the lower left-hand corner of his board and add it to his
estate. The die chosen to carry out this action indicates which corresponding
empty space he may place the tile onto. All newly-placed tiles must always lie
directly adjacent to at least one previously-placed tile. A tile's colour must always
match the colour of the space it is being placed onto.
The first tile can thus only ever be placed onto one of the six spaces surrounding the
start castle'.
Depending on what type of tile was placed, the following occurs immediately
afterwards:
"Knowledge" (yellow): There are 26 different yellow tiles whose functions are
described in more detail on pages 10 and 11.
Ship (blue): Whenever a player adds a ship tile to his estate (which can occur up
to 6 times), then two things happen immediately:
1. The player takes all of the goods tiles on any one depot's goods space and
adds them to the goods storage in the upper left hand corner of his board.
Important: the chosen depot is completely separate and independent of the die
result that was used to place the ship!
Each player may collect up to three different types of goods (= colours) in his
goods storage. Tiles of the same colour are always piled on top of each other, different
coloured tiles are placed next to each other. If, because of this restriction,
a player cannot store all of the goods tiles present in the chosen
depot, then he simply leaves behind any goods he cannot store.
Example: Carla has added a ship to her estate and subsequently
takes goods tiles from the goods space shown: the turquoise one
(which she adds to her other turquoise good) as well as another one
(pink or brown) which she will add to her still-empty goods storage
space
2. The player moves his playing piece on the turn order track one space to the
right. Should this space be occupied, then he places his piece on top of the other
pieces. Should this result in him being start player for the next round then he
also receives the white die.
? Take six-sided tile from the game
board
Die indicates which depot to take
from; place the tile onto an empty
storage space in the bottom left
hand corner of the board
? Add six-sided tile to your estate
Die indicates which empty space
to place the tile onto; tile must be
adjacent to previously-placed tile(s)
and match the space's colour
"Knowledge" (yellow):
see pages 10 + 11
Ships (blue):
1.) Player takes all
goods tiles from the
depot of his choice and
adds them to his goods
storage
2.) Player moves one space to the
right on the turn order track
Animal (= a region of connected light green spaces): Whenever a player adds
an animal tile to his estate (which can occur up to 6 times), then he immediately
receives victory points (and moves his playing piece on the victory point
track forward). Each tile has between 2 and 4 animals on it and the player
receives the corresponding number of victory points for them.
Should the player already have animals of the same type in the pasture (= a
region of connected light green spaces) that the new tile is being added to, then
he scores all tiles with the same animal type again in addition to the newlyplaced
tile (see example below).
Important: The animal tiles must be part of the same pasture but do not need
to be immediately adjacent to the newly-placed animal tile.
Tiles with the same animal on them on other pastures are
not scored.
Castle (dark green): Whenever a player adds a castle tile to his estate (which
can occur up to 3 times), then he immediately carries out an additional action
of his choice as if he had an extra die with any result he wishes at his disposal.
He could, for example, immediately add another six-sided tile to his estate, or ...
Mine (grey): These tiles are (with the exception of a few of the yellow tiles) the
only ones without an immediate effect when they are placed (which can occur
up to 3 times). Instead, at the end of each phase, the player receives 1 Silverling
from the supply for each mine in his estate.
Building (beige): Whenever a
player adds a building tile to his
estate (which can occur up to 12
times), then he immediately gets to
make a single use of that building's
advantage.
Important: Each of the 8 building
types may only occur once per
city (= a region of connected beige
spaces). Depending on the estate,
there may be between 2 and 6 cities
of different sizes (1 to 8 spaces).
Estate No. 1, for example, has 4 cities: one 1-size, one 5-size and two 3-size.
Each building provides an advantage immediately after having been built.
These are also shown symbolically at left on the player boards.
Animals (lt. green):
Provide victory points
depending on how
many animals are
shown on the tile
When an existing pasture is expanded,
then pre-existing animals are
scored again
Castles (dk. green):
Allow an immediate
additional action
Mines (grey):
Provide 1 Silverling
income each at the end
of each phase
Buildings (beige):
Have various uses
depending on building
type
No identical
buildings in a
city!
Example: Benno adds the topmost 4-cow tile to his
estate. He receives 4 + 3 = 7 victory points for it.
Should he add another 4-cow tile to this pasture later
on, then he would receive 4 + 4 + 3 = 11 victory points
for it.
H77 h
The buildings
Warehouse
When a player adds a warehouse to his estate, he may immediately (without
having to use a die!) sell one goods type of his choice out of his goods storage,
exactly as if he had chosen the Sell goods' action (see page 9).
Carpenter's Workshop
When a player adds a carpenter's workshop to his estate, he may immediately
take one beige-coloured building tile of his choice from any numbered depot
(not from the black depot!) and place it onto an empty storage space in the bottom
left-hand corner of his board.
Church
When a player adds a church to his estate, he may immediately take one mine
(grey), "knowledge" (yellow) or castle (dark green) tile of his choice from any
numbered depot (not from the black depot!) and place it onto an empty storage
space in the bottom left-hand corner of his board.
Market
When a player adds a market to his estate, he may immediately take one ship
(blue) or animal (light green) tile of his choice from any numbered depot (not
from the black depot!) and place it onto an empty storage space in the bottom
left-hand corner of his board.
Boarding House
When a player adds a boarding house to his estate, he immediately takes 4
worker tiles from the general supply and adds them to his own.
Bank
When a player adds a bank to his estate, he immediately takes 2 Silverlings from
the general supply and adds them to his own.
City Hall
When a player adds a city hall to his estate, he may immediately add a second
six-sided tile of his choice to his estate from one of his three storage spaces,
regardless of colour (and including all of its effects!).
Watchtower
When a player adds a watchtower to his estate, he immediately moves his playing
piece on the victory point track forward by 4 spaces.
Warehouse:
Player sells the goods
type of his choice
Carpenter's Workshop
Player takes the
building tile of his
choice from the game
board
Boarding House:
Player takes 4 worker
tiles
Bank
Player takes 2 Silverlings
City Hall:
Player adds an additional
six-sided tile of his
choice to his estate
Watchtower:
Player receives 4 victory
points
Church:
Player takes the mine,
"knowledge" or castle
tile of his choice from
the game board
Market:
Player takes the animal
or ship tile of his choice
from the game board
Fundamentally, when placing all buildings:
Their additional advantages are activated' via their placement, a die result (=
action) is not required!
Should a player not be able to make use of a building's advantage (because,
for example, there aren't any more blue or light green tiles left in the numbered
depots after having placed a market), then the building may still be added
(although the advantage is lost in this case).
The supply of worker tiles and Silverlings is not intended to be limited. In the
rare case that the supply is exhausted, please substitute other materials.
Additional rules for placing six-sided tiles:
 Whenever a player takes a six-sided tile from the game board, he must always
first place it onto a storage space in the lower left-hand corner of his board.
This is still the case even if he uses his second action to immediately add it to
his estate.
Six-sided tiles, once added to an estate, may never be moved or removed.
As soon as a coloured region  regardless of its size  is completely
covered with tiles, then this region is considered to be complete and
scores victory points in two different ways:
1. Depending on its size (1 to 8 spaces), the completed region
scores between 1 and 36 victory points which are immediately
scored on the victory point track.
2. Additionally, the region  depending on the phase  scores
between 10 and 2 victory points: The empty phase
space (A-E, in the upper right of the game board)
for the current phase indicates how many additional
victory points each completed region (regardless of
its size!) is worth: between 10 in the first phase (A) and 2 in the last phase (E).
 The first player who manages to cover all spaces of one colour in his entire
estate with tiles (by placing his third mine, for example, or his sixth animal tile)
immediately takes the corresponding large bonus tile from the game board. He
immediately scores victory points depending on the
number of players (5 victory points with 2 players, 6
victory points with 3 players or 7 victory points with
4 players).
The second player to finish covering up this same
colour takes the small bonus tile and the corresponding
2 to 4 victory points. Third and fourth place receive nothing.
Note: As soon as a player reaches or exceeds 100 victory points on the victory
point track, then he places his victory point tile onto his board with the 100
side up. The tile should be placed in the upper right
hand corner, next to the used die storage.
When a player reaches 200 victory
points, then he flips his tile
over
Building advantages never need a
die result for activation
Never add tiles directly to an estate
from the game board
Tiles added to an estate remain
there until the end of the game
As soon as a district is completely
covered with tiles, it scores victory
points in two different ways:
1.) Depending on its size (1-8
spaces): 1-36 victory points
2.) Depending on the phase (A-E):
10-2 victory points
The first player to cover up all
spaces of one colour in his estate
receives the corresponding large
bonus tile and its associated victory
points (2-4 players: 5-7 VP)
The second player to accomplish
this receives the small bonus tile and
its associated victory points
(2-4 players: 2-4 VP)

Action "Sell goods":
A player may choose to sell all goods of one type from his goods storage.
The die chosen to carry out this action indicates which goods type (=
colour) may be sold. All corresponding goods tiles in the player's goods storage are
piled, face-down, onto the goods storage space on the player's board intended for
this purpose. For doing this, the player receives:
- exactly one Silverling from the supply, regardless of how many tiles he just sold (=
turned face-down), as well as
- 2, 3 or 4 victory points per tile (depending on the number of players).
Note: A player must always sell all tiles of a type when choosing the "Sell Goods"
action, even if he would like to keep some in reserve.
Action "Take worker tiles":
Finally, a player may choose to use any die result to take 2 worker
tiles from the general supply. In this case, the die result itself is
meaningless.
The central black depot:
In addition to his two dice actions, each player may, once per turn, choose to
buy one of the six-sided tiles from the central black depot. He may do this at any
point during his turn: before, between or after the dice actions.
To accomplish this, the player must return 2 Silverlings to the general
supply and subsequently place the newly-purchased six-sided tile, as
with any tile from the game board, onto an empty storage space in
the lower left-hand corner of his board.
End of a phase:
A phase ends after five rounds. Players with mines now receive the corresponding
number of Silverlings. Some of the yellow "knowledge" tiles may also have
an effect. The next phase then begins.
The game ends after the fifth phase has been played through to completion. Final
scoring follows, during which players receive victory points for the following:
- each unsold goods tile: 1 victory point
- each remaining Silverling: 1 victory point
- every two worker tiles: 1 victory point
- each VP-bearing yellow tile (see pages 10 and 11).
(Note: Six-sided tiles remaining on the storage spaces of a player's board are
not scored!)
The player who is the farthest along on the victory point track is the winner. In
the case of a tie, the winning player is the tied player with the fewest empty estate
spaces. Should there still be a tie, then the winning player is the tied player who
went later in turn order.
Sell Goods:
Die result indicates goods type: all
goods of this type must be sold
(= turned over):
 + 1 Silverling per sale
 + 2-4 VP per tile
(with 2-4 players)
Take Worker Tiles
Regardless of die result, the player
takes 2 worker tiles from the general
supply
Once per turn, each player may pay
2 Silverlings to buy one tile of their
choice from the black depot
A phase ends after 5 rounds: All
players with mines receive new
Silverlings (and note any "knowledge"
tiles!)
GAME END:
The game ends at the end of the 5th
phase (= 25 rounds/ 50 dice actions)
The following are scored:
 remaining goods tiles: 1 VP
 per Silverling: 1 VP
 per 2 worker tiles: 1 VP
 yellow tiles: X VP
The player with the most victory
points is the winner

The game includes 26 different yellow tiles. Many have effects that take place
immediately after placement, in that they change certain rules. Others only
come into play during final scoring.
1) The player who adds this tile to his estate may ignore the rule that only one
building of each type is allowed in each city. He may thus add as many buildings
as he likes, without restriction, to his cities.
2) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the
general supply in addition to the usual Silverling for each of his mines at the end
of each phase.
3) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 Silverlings from the
general supply instead of 1 each time he sells goods (either via dice action or by
adding a warehouse to his estate).
4) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one worker tile from the
general supply in addition to the usual Silverling each time he sells goods (either
via dice action or by adding a warehouse to his estate).
5) The player who adds this tile to his estate may, when adding a ship to his
estate, choose to take goods tiles not from one but from two neighbouring goods
spaces and add them to his goods storage.
6) The player who adds this tile to his estate may buy not only from the central
black depot but also from the other six depots (i.e. from all seven). That player
may still only make one purchase per turn.
7) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 1 victory point more for
each animal tile (i.e. not for each individual animal!) that scores points when a
new animal tile is added.
Example: Benno adds a 3 sheep tile to a pasture that already has a 4 sheep
tile. He scores (3+1) + (4+1) = 9 victory points. Should he later add a 2 pig
tile to this pasture, then it would score 3 victory points.
8) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust a die result by up to +/-
2 per worker tile that he pays.
Example: To make a 3 out of a 6, Carla would now only need 2 worker
tiles.
9) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust all die results being
used to place buildings (beige tiles) by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile
for them.
10) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust all die results being
used to place ships or animals (blue or light green tiles) by +/- 1, just as if he had
used a worker tile for them.
The Yellow Tiles
H1111 h
11) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust all die results being
used to place castles, mines or "knowledge" (dark green, grey or yellow tiles)
by +/- 1, just as if he had used a worker tile for them.
12) The player who adds this tile to his estate may adjust any die results being
used to take new six-sided tiles from the game board by +/- 1, just as if he had
used a worker tile for them.
13) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives one Silverling in addition
to the usual 2 worker tiles each time he chooses the "Take worker tiles"
dice action.
Note: This tile has no effect when adding a boarding house.
14) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 4 (instead of the usual
2) worker tiles each time he chooses the "Take worker tiles" dice action.
15) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 3 victory points at the
end of the game for each goods type that he has sold at least one goods tile of.
Unsold goods are ignored. Note: Players may look at their sold goods tiles at any
time.
Example: Dario has sold the following goods tiles: 4x red, 3x violet, 3x pink
and 1x orange. He receives 4 types x 3 victory points = 12 VP.
16-23) The players who add these tiles (Nos. 16-23) to their estates receive 4
victory points at the end of the game for each corresponding building that has
been added to their estates.
Example: Benno has yellow tiles 17 (watchtowers) and 22 (banks) in his estate
at the end of the game, along with 2 watchtowers and 4 banks. He receives
(2 x 4) + (4 x 4) = 24 victory points for them.
24) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 4 victory points at the
end of the game for each animal type that has been added to his estate.
Example: Anna has 1 cow, 1 chicken and 3 sheep tiles at the end of the
game. She receives 3 types x 4 victory points = 12 VP.
25) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 1 victory point at the
end of the game for each sold goods tile. Unsold goods are ignored.
Should Dario have also owned this tile, then he would have received 11
VP for it (see example under tile 15 above).
26) The player who adds this tile to his estate receives 2 victory points at the
end of the game for each bonus tile he claimed, regardless whether they are
large or small.

VARIANTS:
Those who know the game well
... can make the following changes during Game Setup: After all typical
game setup is complete and players have determined the player order, each
player receives a random player board. Players are free to choose which side
(front or back) of the board they wish to use, as well as which (dark green)
space they will place their starting castle on.
Players should agree ahead of time whether these decisions will be made openly
(one after the other in turn order) or secretly (all players simultaneously).

GAME NAME:
Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game

OVERVIEW:
"The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their
dreams."
Eleanor Roosevelt

Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game is a game for two to
four players, with four players being recommended. Each player
takes charge of a different civilization and attempts to lead their
people to greatness.
Starting with a civilization composed of a single, humble
city lacking even the most rudimentary of inventions, each
player tries to advance their people by building new cities and
improving them, researching new technologies, increasing their
civilization's culture, and harvesting valuable resources.
As the players create new cities and explore the world around
them, they come into contact with smaller civilizations,
some peaceful, some warlike. Players can absorb these minor
civilizations into their own, garnering rewards for doing so.
Ultimately, however, the players' most difficult challenge is
facing each other, as one ascendant civilization collides with
another. Players may wage war on the battlefield, broker sly
deals in the shadows, or race to be the first to build the majestic
wonders in order to become the dominant civilization on Earth.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME:
"Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let
us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it."
Abraham Lincoln
Each player can win Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game
in one of four ways.
A culture victory is achieved by devoting cities to the arts and
spending the culture points gained as a result to advance up the
culture track to its end. The culture track is described in more
detail on pages 1718.
A tech victory is accomplished by researching the Space Flight
tech. Doing so requires the player to build up their tech pyramid
high enough to allow them to research a level 5 tech. The tech
pyramid is described in more detail on pages 11 and 2122.
An economic victory is completed by accumulating 15 coins.
Coins are a measure of economic power, and gaining them
makes a civilization more efficient. Coins and the means to
acquire them are described in more detail on page 26.
Finally, a military victory is achieved by conquering one other
player's capital. Combat and conquering cities are described in
more detail on pages 2326.
A more detailed explanation of how to win the game can be
found in "Winning the Game" on pages 2223.
...And finally there evolved a species known as man.
And there appeared the first faint glimmers of intelligence.
The fruits of intelligence were many:
Fire, tools, and weapons,
The hunt, farming, and the sharing of food,
The family, the village, and the tribe.
Now it required but one more ingredient:
A great leader to unite the quarreling tribes,
To harness the power of the land,
To build a legacy that would stand the test of time:
The civilization.

Component Descriptions:
This section identifies each component of Sid Meier's
Civilization: The Board Game.
Market Board
The market board consists of two main areas  the market and
the culture area. The market, at the top, is where wonders,
buildings, and units are placed for the players to purchase. The
culture area, at the bottom, contains the culture track  which
tracks the players' progress towards a culture victory  and
provides a place to keep the culture event cards during play.
Civilization Sheets
Each player receives a civilization sheet that explains the
special properties of their civilization. See "Civilization Sheet
Breakdown" on page 7 for further details.
Trade Dial, Economy Dial,
and Plastic Connecto rs
The trade and economy dials are attached to each player's
civilization sheet using the plastic connectors and are used to
track their civilization's current trade and number of coins.
Map Tiles
These tiles include both home and neutral map tiles, and are used
to construct the map board. Each map tile is composed of 16
squares of terrain. See the "Map Tile and Icon Breakdown" on
page 7 for further details.
Home Map Tiles
Each of these six map tiles belongs to a specific civilization, as
indicated by the picture of the civilization's leader on the back of
its home tile. At the start of the game, each player's home tile is
where their civilization begins on the map board.
Neutral Map Tiles
These 14 map tiles do not belong to any specific civilization.
Instead, they are shuffled up and laid out facedown at random to
construct the rest of the map board during setup.
City Markers
Cities are indicated on the map by city markers. Each player
receives three city markers  one capital and two normal cities.
City markers have a walled version on their back.
Capital City
Walled Capital Walled City
Plastic Army and Scout Figures
These plastic figures represent the players' armies and scouts.
The plastic flags are armies and represent the players' military
forces. The plastic wagons are scouts and represent the players'
non-military forces.
Note: The white army figure is for the Russian player's use, as
explained in "Player Setup" on pages 1011.
Army Figures Scout Figures
Unit Cards
Each unit card represents either an artillery, infantry, mounted,
or aircraft unit. Each unit card (except for aircraft) has four
different versions of the unit depicted around its four edges.
Each player uses the most powerful version of the unit that
their civilization's tech pyramid allows. Unit cards are more
completely described on page 23.
Combat Bonus Cards
These cards are used at the start of combat to record any strength
advantages one player has over the other in the battle.
Setup Cards
The setup cards list all of the items that the players start the
game with. On the other side of these cards, all items that can be
built at the start of the game are shown, as well as the starting
values of any important civilization traits, such as travel speed.
Government Cards
These cards are used to indicate what type of government a
player's civilization is currently ruled by. Each card is doublesided,
with a different type of government on each side. A
player's civilization sheet shows what type of government
their civilization begins the game with. For further details on
governments, see page 14.
Tech Cards
Tech cards represent various technologies or discoveries that a
civilization can research to give them access to buildings, units,
governments, or other abilities. Each player receives an identical
deck of tech cards with which to track their civilization's
scientific progress. For a complete description of tech cards and
the tech pyramid, see pages 11 and 2122.
Note: Space Flight is a special level 5 tech card that ends the
game when researched. As such, only one copy of it is included
with the game.
Culture Event Cards
Culture event cards are divided into three decks  ancient
(one column), medieval (two columns), and modern (three columns).
These cards are gained as players move up the culture track.
Culture events have a variety of effects designed to either help
the player who plays the culture event or to hurt that player's
opponents. Culture events are more fully described on page 18.
Wonder Cards and Markers
Wonders are awe-inspiring monuments or accomplishments that
secure a civilization's place in human history. Each wonder has
a card and a marker corresponding to it. The card explains the
wonder's cost and ability, while the marker indicates its position
on the map. For more information on wonders, see page 17.
Wonder Cards Wonder Markers
Culture Level Markers
These markers are used to record the player's progress on the
culture track. For more information, see "B. Devote to the Arts"
on page 17.
Great Person Markers
Great person markers represent famous or important people who
appear in a civilization. There are six different kinds of great
people, as listed below:
Artist Builder General
Humanitarian Industrialist Scientist
Great people provide useful resources to the city they are placed in
and are usually gained by a civilization's advancing up the culture
track. For further information on great people, see page 18.
Military Tech Markers
These markers are used to track the players' military technology.
For more information, see "Upgrading Units" on page 21.
Building Markers
Building markers are used to indicate city improvements that
a player has built in a city's outskirts. Typically, these markers
increase the amount of trade, production, or culture a city
produces each turn, but they may indicate other bonuses as well.
For a complete description of building markers, see pages 1617.
Hut and Village Markers
As players explore the map, they may encounter minor
civilizations. A hut indicates a peaceful civilization that may be
easily absorbed, while a village indicates a warlike civilization
that must be subjugated through force of arms. Huts and villages
are fully described on page 20.
Hut Village
Disaster Markers
The disaster markers (which show grassland on one side and
desert on the other) are used to mark the effects of Deforestation
and Drought culture event cards. Culture events are more fully
explained on page 18.
First Player Marker
The first player marker indicates which player
goes first in each phase on a given turn.
Market Resource Tokens
Certain special resources appear on the map and may be harvested
by the players and later used to activate resource abilities on their
tech cards. The four main resources available are:
Wheat Silk Incense Iron
In addition, there are two resources that cannot be harvested
from the map:
Spy Uranium
Spies and uranium are never found on the map for harvesting,
but spies can be gained from huts and villages. Uranium, on the
other hand, can only be found in villages  and only very rarely
at that.
Culture Tokens
These tokens are used by players to keep track
of unspent culture until it is spent to advance
their culture level markers up the culture track.
Culture is normally gained by devoting a city to the
arts, as described on page 17.
Wound Tokens
Wound tokens are used to keep track of damage
inflicted to units during battle. Combat is described
in detail on pages 2326.
Coin Tokens
Coin tokens are used to record coins gained from
certain tech cards such as Democracy. After a coin
is gained through the use of a tech, a coin token is
placed on that tech and the player's economy dial
is advanced by one. For full details on coins, see
page 26.
Reference Sheets
The reference sheets contain a turn sequence breakdown on one
side and a summary of item costs and some other important rules
on the other.
Map Tile and Icon Breakdown
Civilization Sheet Breakdown
Each civilization sheet contains the
civilization's name (A), leader (B), special
abilities (C), starting government (D), and
starting tech (E). Every civilization sheet also
has two dials (F). A civilization's current trade
( @ ) is tracked on the large outer dial, while
the civilization's total coins ( $ ) are tracked on
the small inner dial.

Mountain Forest Grassland Desert Water
There are five types of terrain that can be found on map tiles:
There are also natural wonders, which are squares that provide
culture ( # ) in addition to their terrain type's normal icons.
Mountain Forest Grassland Desert Water
Each map tile is composed of 16 squares of terrain. Each square
may contain one or more icons and/or resources that the square
can provide to players.

PREPAING FOR THE FIRST GAME:
"The past is but the beginning of a beginning, and all that is or
has been is but the twilight of the dawn."
H. G. Wells
Before playing Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game for
the first time, carefully punch out the cardboard components,
making sure to keep them away from small children and
animals.
Then, take the civilization sheets, trade dials, economy dials, and
plastic connectors and assemble them as shown below.
For the first game, it is recommended that new players play a
simplified learning game. Simply return Egypt, Rome, and the
wonders (both cards and markers) to the box, and then ignore
the rules for wonders for that game. Otherwise, play as normal
until a player builds their third city. At that point, end the game
and (if time allows and the players so desire) start a new game
after adding Egypt, Rome, and the wonders back in. The point of
the learning game is to familiarize the players with the various
elements of the game, so there are no winners or losers in it.

GAME SETUP:
This section explains the general setup of the game.
1. Choo se Civilizations and Colors
Each player draws a civilization sheet at random and places it
faceup in front of them. Optionally, players may select their
civilizations if all players agree. Return any unused civilization
sheets to the box. Each player then chooses a player color.
2. Distribute Player Components
Each player takes the following in their player color:
Eight plastic fi  gures (6 armies and 2 scouts)
 Three city markers (1 capital and 2 cities)
 Four military tech markers
 One deck of 36 tech cards
Players also receive:
 One reference sheet
 One setup card
 One deck of government cards (4 cards)
3. Set Up Market Board
Place the market board at one end of the table, as shown in the
diagram on page 9. On it, place the following:
A. Unit Cards
Sort the unit cards by type  artillery, infantry, mounted, and
aircraft. Then, shuffle each deck, and place it on the marked space.
Finally, give each player one artillery, one infantry, and one
mounted unit. These units are placed facedown in a single pile
near the player and are known as the player's standing forces.
B. Military Tech Markers
Each player takes their lower ranked (one stripe on one side, two
stripes on the other) military tech markers for artillery, infantry,
and mounted units and places them in the area below the
appropriate unit deck so that the sides with one stripe are faceup.
They each then take their aircraft military marker and place
it below the aircraft unit deck so that the side with the star is
facedown. The other military tech markers are set aside for now.
C. Building Markers
Sort the building markers by type and place them on their
indicated spaces. Note that a building with an arrow next to its
name is an upgraded building and is found on the back of the
un-upgraded building tile.
D. Wonder Cards (not used in the learning game)
Build the wonder deck by shuffling the ancient, medieval, and
modern wonders separately. Place the modern wonders facedown
on the top space of the wonder market. Then place the medieval
wonders (also facedown) on top of them. Finally, place the ancient
wonders faceup in the four market spaces below the wonder deck.
Exception: If Egypt is playing, Egypt receives one of the ancient
wonders at random before the remainder are placed in the
market. One of the medieval wonders is then drawn and placed
in the market to replace the missing ancient wonder.
8
Many of the abilities and cards in this
game allow the players to break the rules
in a variety of ways. In the event that an
ability or card conflicts with these rules,
the ability or card takes priority.

Setup Diagram
(Numbers refer to General Setup steps.)
Map Setup by Number of Players
(Arrows indicate tile orientation.)
E. Wonder Markers (not used in the learning game)
Look at the four faceup wonder cards in the market spaces below
the wonder deck, find the matching wonder marker for each, and
place the marker in the space next to its wonder card.
F. Culture Event Cards
Separate the culture event cards into ancient (one column),
medieval (two columns), and modern (three columns) decks.
Shuffle each deck separately and place it facedown on its indicated
space below the culture track at the bottom of the market board.
G. Culture Level Markers
Each player takes the culture level marker showing their leader
and places it on the start space of the culture track.
4. Set Up Market Resources
Place one of each market resource token per player near the market
board, returning any extras to the box. For instance, if there are
three players, three of each market resource token are used and the
remaining market resource tokens are returned to the box.
5. Build Map
Each player takes their home map tile (the map tile with their
civilization's leader on the back) and places it faceup in front of
them, oriented as indicated in the setup diagram for the proper
number of players. Unused home tiles are returned to the box.
Then, one player shuffles the neutral map tiles and deals them
out facedown to form the rest of the map, again as indicated by
the diagram on page 4. Return any unused neutral map tiles to
the box without looking at them.
6. Shuffle Rando m Markers
Place the great people markers facedown near the market board
and mix them up, keeping them facedown. Repeat this process
for the hut markers and then the village markers.
7. Form Token Banks
Place the culture, wound, and coin tokens next to the market
board in three separate stockpiles.
8. Place Special Cards and Markers
Place the combat bonus cards and the Space Flight tech card
faceup near the market board along with the disaster markers.
9. Select First Player
Choose a player to go first. Either choose the player who can
trace their family history back the farthest, or select at random.
Give the chosen player the first player marker. Finally, each
player individually sets up their civilization by taking the steps
in the next section.

PLAYER SETUP:
After general setup is complete, each player does the following:
1. Place Capital
Each player chooses one of the four center squares on their
home map tile to place their capital on. For a player's first
game, they are advised to use the square with the starting arrow
(highlighted in red below) on it.
The player places their capital city marker on the selected
square, unwalled side up. That square is known as the city
center, while the eight squares adjacent to it (the squares with
arrows pointing to them on the diagram below) are known as the
city outskirts.
10
2. Gain Civilization Bonuses
Each player looks at their civilization sheet to see what, if
anything, they receive as a bonus at the start of the game. The
bonuses are summarized below:
America
America gains a random great person. America places the great
person in the outskirts of their capital at the end of setup. (For a
player's first game, it is recommended that they place the great
person in the grassland square next to their capital).
China
China starts with walls in its capital. China turns their capital
city marker so that the marker's walled side is up instead of its
unwalled side.
Egypt
Egypt receives a random ancient wonder. This wonder should
have already been taken from the market board during general
setup. Its marker must be placed in the outskirts of the player's
capital. (For a player's first game, it is recommended that they
place the wonder marker in the grassland square by their capital.)
Germany
Germany starts with two extra infantry units from the market
board, adding the units to their standing forces.
Rome
Rome begins the game governed by Republic instead of by
Despotism, as described in step 5 of player setup, later on.
Russia
Russia takes the white Russian army figure and adds it to their
figures. When figures are placed on the map in step 3 (below),
Russia places the white army figure on the map as well. In
addition, Russia begins the game governed by Communism
instead of Despotism, as described in step 5 of player setup, later
on.
3. Place Figures
Each player takes one of their army figures and one of their scout
figures and places them (either separately or together) in one (or
two) of the city outskirts squares of their capital. Figures cannot
be placed in water squares at the start of the game.
4. Learn Starting Tech
Each player looks at the bottom of their civilization sheet to
see what tech card they begin with, searches through their tech
deck for the indicated card, and places it faceup in front of them,
leaving plenty of room around it.
Note: The level of a player's starting tech is irrelevant during
setup. The tech is always placed in the bottom row of the player's
tech pyramid. If another player learns that tech through any
means, the tech is still considered to be its normal level. (See
"The Tech Pyramid" sidebar on this page and "Research" on
page 20 for more information about tech cards.)
11
The Tech Pyramid
the pyramid (along with the player's starting tech), level II techs
form the second row, and so on, up to level V. While a player
may learn any number of level I techs, each level II tech a player
researches must be placed above two level I techs, as shown
below. Similarly, each level III tech a player learns must be
placed above two level II techs, etc. For further information, see
"Research" on page 20.
Level I Techs
(And Starting Tech)

Tech
Over the course of the game, each civilization must advance
socially and technologically, or find itself at a disadvantage to
more sophisticated civilizations. These advances are represented
by tech cards.
Tech cards researched by a player are arranged in a pyramid
shape as they are acquired. Level I techs form the bottom row of
5. Set Starting Governments
Each player stacks their government cards so that the Despotism/
Republic card is on top of the cards, with the Despotism side
faceup. They then place the stack of cards on the indicated space
on their civilization sheet.
Exceptions: Rome begins as a Republic, while Russia begins
governed by Communism. They must each place the proper
government card with the appropriate side faceup on top of their
government cards instead of Despotism.
Note: The government cards have different governments on each
side. If a player is having trouble finding their government, they
should check the backs of their government cards!
6. Set Trade Dial
Each player counts all of the trade symbols ( @ ) in the eight
squares of their capital's city outskirts and then sets the trade
dial (the large outer dial) on their civilization sheet to that total.
For example, if a total of three trade symbols are in the outskirts
of a player's capital, the player sets their trade dial to "3."
Note: Players collect trade again on the first turn of the game.
7. Set Economy Dial
Each player sets the economy dial (the small inner dial) on their
civilization sheet to "0."
Note: It is possible for some players to receive a coin from a map
square or great person during setup. If this is the case, the player
sets their economy dial to the number equal to the number of
coins they have, instead.
8. Place Unbuilt Figures
Finally, each player places one city marker, their remaining
five army figures, and their remaining scout figure by their
civilization sheet to indicate that they are ready to be built. The
other city marker is set aside until the player learns the Irrigation
tech, at which point it is added to the available items as well.
Game Turn Overview
Civilization is played over a number of game turns, each of
which is composed of five phases. These phases are performed in
the order listed below. During each phase, starting with the first
player and continuing clockwise around the table, every player
has the opportunity to perform the actions associated with that
phase. The phases of a turn are as follows:
1. Start of Turn
2. Trade
3. City Management
4. Movement
5. Research
1. Start of Turn
During this phase, the first player marker is passed one player
to the left (except on the first turn). Then, the new first player
performs any start of turn actions (usually found on wonders
or culture event cards), builds any new cities (see page 13), and
changes governments if desired (see page 14). After the first
player completes their Start of Turn Phase, the player to the
first player's left begins their Start of Turn Phase. This process
continues until all players have completed their Start of Turn
Phase.
2. Trade
During this phase, each player collects trade from all of their
cities, and then the players may negotiate with each other,
trading a variety of game resources up to and including
promises (see pages 1415). This phase may be simultaneously
performed by every player to save time.
3. City Management
In the City Management Phase, the first player takes one action
with each of their cities. A city may produce an item (such as a
building or unit card), devote itself to the arts to gain culture, or
harvest a resource as its action (see pages 1518). After the first
player completes their City Management Phase, play passes to
the left and the next player completes their City Management
Phase, until all players have done so.
4. Movement
During the Movement Phase, the first player moves each of their
figures (armies and scouts) up to a number of squares equal
to the player's travel speed. A civilization's travel speed starts
at two and is increased by certain tech cards, such as Sailing.
Movement may cause battles to occur and facedown map tiles to
be revealed (see page 19). After the first player completes their
entire Movement Phase, play passes to the left and the next player
completes their Movement Phase, until all players have done so.
5. Research
During the Research Phase, each player may learn one new tech
by spending trade. They then add their newly learned tech to
their tech pyramid (see page 20). Unlike most other phases, this
phase is always performed simultaneously by every player.

GAME TURN:
This section explains each phase of the turn in detail.
1. Start of Turn
During this phase, players can expand their civilizations and
change their civilizations' form of government. The first player
has the first opportunity to perform those actions during the
Start of Turn Phase. After the first player has performed all the
start of turn actions they wish to, play passes to the player's left,
and the next player may then perform all of their desired start of
turn actions, until all players have had a chance to do so.
Building New Cities
"A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one."
Aristotle
To become a dominant civilization, a player's civilization must
expand geographically beyond its isolated, provincial origins.
The Building New Cities action enables a civilization to do so.
This action allows a player to construct a new city, which then
lets them take more city actions each turn.
During the Start of Turn Phase, if a player has fewer built cities
than their maximum number of cities (two normally, three if the
player has researched the Irrigation tech), they may build one
or more new cities on the map, provided that doing so does not
take the player above their maximum number of cities. To build
a new city, the player must first have a scout figure (representing
settlers) in each square that they wish to place a city marker in.
In addition, that square must meet the following requirements:
The square c  annot be a water square.
 There must be eight revealed squares adjacent to the square
(i.e., no cities may be placed on the edge of the map or next to
a facedown map tile).
 The square cannot be adjacent to a hut or village token (once
the tokens are removed from the map, however, the squares
they were in/adjacent to become fair game).
 The square cannot be adjacent to an enemy figure (either
army or scout). Friendly figures may be adjacent, or even in
the same square as the scout.
 The square must be at three squares or more away from
any other city marker, including diagonals (i.e., the city's
outskirts must not overlap any other city's outskirts).
If these requirements are met, the player sacrifices the scout,
removing it from the board and returning it to their civilization
sheet. Then, the player places a city marker on the space,
unwalled side up. As mentioned earlier, this square is called the
city center of the new city, and the eight squares adjacent to it
are now the city outskirts.
Note: The city center never generates anything. Its icons are
effectively erased as long as the city marker remains. Only
squares in a city's outskirts provide icons and resources.
If there are any friendly figures in the square where a city
is being built besides the scout being sacrificed, the player
immediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can
legally end their movement in.
A city starts generating trade and production right away, so it
produces trade during this turn's Trade Phase (see page 14) and
receives an action during the City Management Phase (see pages
1518).
City Placement Example: On the diagram below, the green
squares are the only legal squares a new city can be built in. The
red squares all mark sample illegal city placements. The reason
each red square cannot have a city built in it is listed below.
 A can't have a city built in it because it is a water square.
 B is illegal because it is adjacent to the village token to its
right (but would be legal once the village token is removed
from that square).
 C is adjacent to a facedown map tile.
 D is adjacent to the green enemy army below it.
 E is less than three squares away from the city above it.

Changing Governments
"A great wind is blowing, and that gives you either imagination
or a headache."
Catherine the Great
A civilization's government reflects its character and its overall
goals, and over time, a civilization may pass through many
types of government as its character changes. In this game,
government cards indicate what form of rulership a player's
civilization has. Governments are special cards unlocked
(see page 21) through tech cards that allow a player to focus on
certain strategies, usually to the detriment of other strategies. At
the start of the game, players have only unlocked the Despotism
government and begin with it in play. (Exception: Rome and
Russia each have another government unlocked as well, which
they start the game with as their form of government.)
Once a player unlocks a new form of government during the
Research Phase as the result of learning a new tech, they may
change to that government during the Start of Turn Phase of
the following turn. To do so, they simply look through their
government deck, locate the corresponding government card,
and place it with the appropriate side faceup on top of their
government deck. This change represents the fact that their
civilization has switched over to the new form of government.
However, a player only has one opportunity to change directly to
a new government. If the player wishes to change to a different
government on any turn other than the turn immediately after
unlocking that government, they must first change to the
Anarchy transitional government. This special transitional
government represents the upheaval occurring in the civilization
and prevents the player from taking an action with their capital
that turn. If a player's civilization is in Anarchy, they may
change to any other government they know during the Start of
Turn Phase of the next turn after entering Anarchy.
Note: Any ongoing benefits from a government, such as the
abilities on Republic or the coin on Feudalism, only last while a
player's civilization continues to be ruled by that government.
2. Trade
The following activities may be performed by the players during
the Trade Phase: collecting trade and negotiating and trading.
Players may all perform these actions simultaneously to save
time.
Collecting Trade
During the Trade Phase, each player tallies up all of the trade
symbols ( @ ) in the city outskirts of all of their cities and
then increases the trade dial on their civilization sheet by that
amount (up to a maximum of 27 trade). For example, if a player
has two cities, one with four trade symbols in its outskirts and
the other with eight trade symbols in its outskirts, that player
increases their trade dial by 12 on their civilization sheet. Unlike
production (see page 15), trade may be saved from turn to turn if
not spent.
Note: When increasing or decreasing the trade dial, make sure to
count the spaces marked "I," "II," "III," "IV," and "V." Although
labeled differently from the other values, these spaces must be
counted as usual. So, for instance, a player who gains three trade
while at "3" on their trade dial would advance their dial to the
"I" space rather than the "7."
Scouts and Blockades
Scout figures have the ability to gather any trade symbols in the
square they inhabit each turn. For full details on this, see "Scout
Gathering" on page 26.
A square in a city's outskirts that contains one or more enemy
figures (either scouts or armies) does not produce trade for the
city's owner. For full details on this, see "Blockades" on page 27.
Trade ( @ ) vs. Prod uction ( ! )
Trade Prod uction
Pooled from all of a civilization's cities. Spent from only one city at a time.
Can be saved from turn to turn on the
civilization's trade dial. Cannot be saved. Any production not spent is lost.
May be converted to production (see "Rushing
Production with Trade" on page 15). Cannot be converted to trade.
Trade ( @ ) represents commerce and scientific progress in a civilization. It is primarily spent to research new techs.
Production ( ! ) represents a city's industry. It is used to produce figures, units, buildings, or wonders.
Trade and production are contrasted below.

Negotiating and Trading
"Politics is war without bloodshed, while war is politics with
bloodshed."
Mao Zedong
It is often advantageous for civilizations to trade with each other
and make alliances. Such trades might provide needed help at a
critical moment for a civilization or a steady supply of a resource
a civilization lacks. After trade is collected during the Trade
Phase, players may negotiate and/or trade among themselves.
Trades are fairly open, and may include an exchange of any or all
of the following:
 Non-binding Promises
 Points of Trade
 Unspent Culture Tokens (see page 17)
 Resource Tokens (either from the market or from hut/village
tokens)
 Culture Event Cards (see page 18)
Note: If a player exceeds their culture hand size as a result of a
trade, they must immediately discard down to their hand size.
Items not on the list above may not be given or traded to another
player unless specifically allowed by a card or ability.
3. City Management
"Waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both.
Without industry and frugality, nothing will do, and with them
everything."
Benjamin Franklin
Managing the industrial capacity of a civilization is a formidable
task, and the City Management Phase is when players do so.
During it, players must balance production, developing their
culture, and gathering resources, or focus on some of them to
the detriment of the others. The first player completes their
City Management Phase first, then play passes to the player on
their left, and so on, until all players have completed their City
Management Phase. The following actions may be performed by
the players during the City Management Phase.
City Actions
During the City Management Phase, each player takes one action
with each of their cities. This action can be used for one and
only one of the following three purposes each turn:
A. Produce a Figure, Unit, Building, or Wonder
B. Devote to the Arts
C. Harvest a Resource
A. Prod uce a Figure, Unit, Building, or Wonder
Cities often turn their industry towards the creation of things
for the common good. When a city is used for production, it can
produce any one item with a production cost equal to or less
than the total number of production symbols ( ! ) contained in
that city's outskirts. The entire production cost for an item must
come from the city producing it. Multiple cities cannot combine
their production together to produce an item. Any excess
production in the city is wasted; it cannot be saved for a future
turn. For example, the city shown below has 5 ! symbols in its
outskirts, so it may use its action to produce one item that costs 5
! or less each turn.
Scouts and Blockades
Scout figures have the ability to gather any production symbols
in the square they inhabit each turn. For full details on this, see
"Scout Gathering" on page 26.
A square in a city's outskirts that contains one or more enemy
figures (either scouts or armies) does not generate production
for the city's owner. For full details on this, see "Blockades" on
page 27.
Rushing Production with Trade
If a city does not have enough production to produce a desired
item, the player may choose to spend some of their trade to make
up the difference. For every 3 points a player reduces their
trade dial by, the player may boost the production in one of
their cities by 1 for a single turn. A player may do this as often
as they like, so long as they can afford the trade to do so.
Producing Figures
At some point in their history, most civilizations are forced to
muster armies, or, at the very least, send explorers and diplomats
out into the world. A player may produce an army or scout figure
with a city's action, assuming they have at least one unbuilt
figure of that type and meet the figure's production cost. When a
figure is produced, the player takes one of the figures from next
to their civilization sheet and places it in the outskirts of the city
that produced it. Figures may not be placed in a water square
unless the player has learned a tech that allows their figures to
end their movement in water (such as Sailing, Steam Power,
or Flight). Figures may be placed in the same square as other
friendly figures, but the total figures in a square cannot exceed
that civilization's stacking limit (see "Moving Groups and
Stacking Limit" on page 19).

Armies
Army figures represent a civilization's military forces and cost
4 ! each. Army figures are the only figures that can fight battles
and explore huts and villages.
Scouts
Scout figures represent a civilization's non-military forces and
cost 6 each. Scouts may be used to build new cities (see page
13) or to gather extra trade, production, or other resources for a
city (see "Scout Gathering," on page 26).
Scouts cannot enter squares containing huts or villages and are
killed immediately any time they are attacked by an army, unless
they have a friendly army escorting them.
Producing Units
War is and always has been one of the central preoccupations of
civilization. To make war, a civilization needs armies, and these
armies are built out of smaller forces, known as units. Unit cards
represent specific units in an army. To produce a unit, a player
checks to make sure that the city's production is high enough to
produce the chosen type of unit, and then the player draws a unit
card at random from the appropriate deck and adds it to their
standing forces pile.
Artillery, infantry, and mounted units are unlocked and able
to be produced with a city's action from the start of the game,
but aircraft units require the player to know the Flight tech to
produce them. If a unit deck is empty, units of that type are not
available to be produced until some are killed and returned to the
deck. If players go through the entire deck of a type of unit and
arrive at units that have been returned faceup to the bottom of
the deck, they must turn the deck over and shuffle it.
To determine the production cost of a unit, the player looks at the
market board to see how advanced their units of that type are.
The more advanced the unit, the more expensive it is.
Rank 1 artillery, infantry, or m  ounted units cost 5 ! each.
 Rank 2 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 7 ! each.
 Rank 3 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 9 ! each.
 Rank 4 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 11 ! each.
 Aircraft units always cost 12 ! each (once unlocked).
Note: Because advanced units are more expensive, it is most cost
effective to produce the units while they are cheaper and then
upgrade them (see page 21).
Producing Buildings
A civilization's buildings do more than simply house its citizens.
They are the sites of a civilization's industry, commerce, and
learning  all of which are invaluable to the civilization's
success. In order to produce a building, the player must first
know a tech that unlocks it. A building's ! cost is indicated
on the tech that unlocks it as well as on the market board. For
example, the Pottery tech unlocks the Granary and indicates that
the Granary's ! cost is 5.
Like units, buildings are limited to the number of components
available. Once all buildings of a certain type have been
produced, no more can be produced until one of the existing
buildings of that type is destroyed.
Once produced, a building must be placed in the outskirts of the
city that produced it. However, buildings are restricted as to what
type of terrain they can be built on. The type of terrain that a
building is restricted to is indicated on the market board and is
listed below. Normally, any number of a given type of building
may be built in a city as long as suitable terrain exists.
Exception: Limited buildings (marked with a star on their
markers) are restricted to one per city. See page 17 for further
details.
Buildings Terrains Allowed
Harbor Water
Trading Post Desert
Workshop/Iron Mine Mountain
Library/University
Granary/Aqueduct Grassland
Market/Bank
Temple/Cathedral
Barracks/Academy
Any Terrain Except Water
(One per City)
Note: Buildings separated by a slash ("/") in their name represent
the basic and upgraded forms of the same building type and are
printed on the front and back of the same markers. For more
information on upgrading buildings, see page 22.
Once a building marker is placed on a square, the icons on the
building completely replace any icons that the square had.
Important Note: A water square with a Harbor placed in it is
still considered to be water for the purposes of movement.
So, if a player builds a Temple in a forest square, that square now
contains two culture ( # ) icons and no production ( ! ) icons,
despite the fact that the forest square previously contained two
production ( ! ) icons.
Not every unit is created equal. Some units are a bit
stronger, while others are a bit weaker. Units range from
1 to 3 strength at rank 1 and increase their strength by 1
per rank from there, up to their maximum at rank 4. The
average strength of a unit at rank 1 is 2.
A Word on Units
Limited Buildings
Some buildings, marked with stars in their upper right corner,
are limited. Although they are less restricted with respect to the
types of terrain they may be placed in, they are more restricted
in another way: a city can only have a total of one limited
building in its outskirts. For example, if a player has already
placed a Market in a city, that player cannot also place a Temple
in that city, since both are limited buildings.
City Walls
Using the Masonry tech, a player may build City Walls around
one or more of their cities. City Walls are treated like any
other building, except that they are considered to be located
in the city's center. To indicate that a city has walls, simply turn
the city marker over so that its walled side is faceup. Only one
City Walls may be built per city.
City Walls are an excellent defensive measure for a player to
build when it appears that one of their cities is in danger of being
attacked. A wall provides +4 to a player's strength total when
defending that city and forces the attacker to play a unit first in
the battle (see pages 2324).
Producing Wonders
Some civilizations construct mighty wonders that survive in
myth and legend long after their creators have died. The Hanging
Gardens are one such wonder. These wonders provide powerful
advantages to the players who build them. Any player may use
a city action to produce one of the wonders that are faceup in
the market. The corresponding wonder card lists the production
cost of the wonder, along with a discounted cost that is available
if the player knows the specific tech listed on the wonder. For
example, the Colossus costs 15 ! normally, but only 10 ! if the
player producing it knows the Metalworking tech.
Note: Remember that cities cannot combine production to
produce an item. The entire cost for the wonder must be paid
by a single city. Converting trade to production, using resource
abilities, and using certain culture event cards can help a player
increase the amount of production a city generates.
Once the wonder has been produced, the player places
the wonder card faceup in front of them and places the
corresponding wonder token in the outskirts of the city that
produced the wonder. After building a wonder, a new wonder is
drawn from the wonder deck and added to the market. Wonders,
like limited buildings, may be placed on any terrain except for
water and are restricted to one per city. A city may contain both
a wonder and one limited building.
Important Note: Wonders are not buildings, and abilities
that affect buildings do not affect wonders unless explicitly
stated.
Obsoleting Wonders
Certain tech cards allow a player to obsolete a wonder, negating
its special ability for the rest of the game. This process is
explained in detail on page 27.
Replacing Buildings and Wonders
A player may choose to replace one of their existing buildings or
wonders when placing a new building or wonder (it is possible
for a wonder to replace a building and vice versa). The new
building or wonder must be able to be legally placed in the
square once the old building or wonder is removed. Players may
not replace a building or wonder belonging to another player.
To replace a building or wonder, first the old building or wonder
is removed from the board. If it is a building, it is returned to
the market. If it is a wonder, the wonder marker and card are
returned to the box and may not be rebuilt for the remainder of
the game.
After the old building or wonder is removed, the new building or
wonder is placed in the now-empty square.
B. Devote to the Arts
"The cry for peace will be a cry in the wilderness, so long as
the spirit of nonviolence does not dominate millions of men and
women."
Mahatma Gandhi
Many great civilizations make their mark on history through art,
song, and literature rather than through industry or conquest.
Consequently, the second type of action a player may take with a
city is to devote the city to the arts. When a player does this, they
collect one culture token from the stockpile, plus one additional
culture token per culture icon ( # ) that appears in the outskirts
of the city being devoted to the arts.
Scouts and Blockades
Scout figures have the ability to gather any culture symbols in
the square they inhabit each turn. For full details on this, see
"Scout Gathering" on page 26.
A square in a city's outskirts that contains one or more enemy
figures (either scouts or armies) does not produce culture for the
city's owner. For full details on this, see "Blockades" on page 27.
Spending Culture
As a civilization creates ever greater and more wondrous pieces
of art, the civilization becomes famous throughout the world.
The amount of fame and cultural influence a civilization has
is measured by the position of the civilization's culture level
marker on the culture track. This marker is advanced through the
spending of culture tokens.
At any point during their City Management Phase, a player may
choose to spend some or all of their culture tokens to advance
their culture level marker up the culture track on the market
board.
The cost to enter each space on the culture track is listed on the
market board and varies depending on how far up the culture
track the player's marker has already advanced. The player
pays the cost listed (for the space their culture level marker is
entering, not the space that the marker is leaving), moves their
culture level marker up the culture track by one space, and then
claims the reward shown on the space their culture level marker
has just entered, as described on the next page.
Higher up the track, advancing the culture level marker costs
trade as well as culture. Both costs must be paid in full for each
space advanced, with trade being spent from the player's trade
dial.

A player may advance as many spaces up the culture track each
turn as they can afford, and multiple culture level markers may
occupy the same space on the culture track.
The culture track consists of three different
types of spaces, which are described below.
Culture Event Spaces
When a player moves their culture level marker
into one of these spaces, they draw a culture
event card from the culture event deck pictured
on the space and add it to their hand in secret.
If doing so causes the player to exceed their
culture hand size (normally two, although it can
be raised by tech), then they must immediately
discard down to their hand size before any culture
event cards can be played.
Great People Spaces
When a player moves their culture level marker into
one of these spaces, they draw a great person marker
at random from the facedown pile. They may then
either immediately place the great person in a city or
hold it in reserve, as described later on this page.
Culture Victory Space
When a player moves their culture level marker
into this space, they immediately win the game with a culture
victory.
Culture Event Cards
"Fortune, which has a great deal of power in other matters but
especially in war, can bring about great changes in a situation
through very slight forces."
Julius Caesar
Culture event cards are special action cards gained by advancing
up the culture track. Each culture event card has a title (A),
timing (B), and an effect (C).
Culture event cards are kept in secret in the player's hand
(although a player may look at their own culture event cards). At
the start of the game, a player's culture hand size is two, meaning
that they can only hold two culture event cards in hand at once.
This number may be increased by tech such as Pottery, however.
As mentioned before, if a player exceeds their culture hand size,
then they must immediately discard down to their hand size
before any culture event cards may be played. Although players
start with a culture hand size of two, they do not actually start
with any culture event cards in hand; these cards must be gained
by advancing up the culture track.
Culture event cards may only be played during the phase
indicated on the card (B, as illustrated earlier). When playing a
culture event card, the player reads the title and the effect and
then performs the effect before discarding the culture event card.
Discarded culture event cards are placed faceup on the bottom of
the appropriate deck. When a deck runs out, it is turned over and
shuffled, creating a new culture event deck.
Great People
"The true test of civilization is, not the census, nor the size of
the cities, nor the crops  no, but the kind of man the country
turns out."
Ralph Waldo Emerson
Certain people rise to prominence within their civilizations.
These great people steer the course of nations and can change
history. Mechanically, great people markers work similarly
to building markers. Once gained, they may be immediately
placed in the outskirts of any city belonging to the player. Great
people can be placed on any terrain except water, and if placed
on a building or wonder, that building or wonder is replaced, as
described on page 17.
However, great people have one significant advantage over
buildings. If they are replaced (by having a building, wonder,
or another great person placed in their square), they are held in
reserve and returned to the player's civilization sheet instead of
being discarded. During the Start of Turn Phase of any turn, a
player may place any great people on their civilization sheet back
on the map in the outskirts of any of their cities. Great people
have no effect when not on the map.
C. Harvest Resources
Valuable resources are important for a civilization's growth.
Without adequate resources, a civilization gradually loses its
ability to function effectively and is swept aside by their better
supplied neighbors. Therefore, the third type of action a city may
take is harvesting a resource from the map. In order to take this
action, the city must have a square with that resource's icon in its
outskirts. If that condition is met, the player takes one resource
token of the given type from the market board and places it on
their civilization sheet. Note that a player cannot harvest a given
resource if the market is out of that type of resource, and a city
may only harvest one resource per action.
For example, if a city contains the icons for two different
resources (silk and iron) in its outskirts, then its city action
may be used to harvest either a silk or an iron token, assuming
any remain. Similarly, if there are two silk icons in the city's
outskirts, the player still only harvests one silk icon.
Resources are used to power resource abilities found on tech
cards. Each time a player wants to use a resource ability, they
must pay its cost by spending the resource (or resources) pictured
next to the ability. For full details, see page 22.
Scouts and Blockades
Scout figures have the ability to allow the harvesting of
resources in the square they inhabit each turn. For full details on
this, see "Scout Gathering" on page 26.
A square in a city's outskirts that contains one or more enemy
figures (either scouts or armies) cannot be harvested from by the
city's owner. For full details on this, see "Blockades" on page 27.
4. Movement
"We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time."
T. S. Eliot
Warriors and explorers have surveyed their surroundings for
as long as mankind has existed, from the earliest tribesman to
today's modern traveler. Players' armies and scouts have their
chance to travel the world during the Movement Phase. During
this phase, each player, in turn, may move all of their figures,
one at a time. Each figure may move up to a number of squares
equal to its civilization's travel speed. A civilization's travel
speed starts at two, but may be increased by learning tech such
as Horseback Riding. Figures cannot move diagonally. Once a
figure has begun its move, it must complete its move before any
other figure may move.
Moving Groups and Stacking Limit
A player may move several of their figures as a group if they
all begin the Movement Phase in the same square. Doing so
can offer extra strength in battle (see page 23) or allow armies
to protect scouts (see page 20). Figures that begin in the same
square are not required to move together.
However, a civilization may never have more figures (armies and
scouts combined) in a single square on the map than its stacking
limit. Like travel speed, a civilization's stacking limit starts at
two, but may be increased by learning tech such as Masonry.
Crossing Water
At the start of the game, figures cannot enter water squares.
However, acquiring certain techs can allow a civilization's
figures to do so. The Navigation tech allows a player's figures to
cross water but not end their movement in a water square. This
means that the player may not make any move that would result
in a figure ending its move in a water square.
Certain higher-level tech cards, such as Sailing, allow a player's
figures to both move through and end their movement on water
squares. Once a player knows one of these techs, they may
ignore water when moving and may place figures on water
squares when producing the figures.
Unexplored Map Tiles
While a map tile remains facedown, figures cannot move onto or
across it for any reason, nor can the effects of any tech or culture
event card cross or affect any square on an unexplored map tile.
Effectively, the squares on an unexplored tile do not exist.
Discovering Unexplored Map Tiles
A player may discover a facedown map tile by spending one
square of movement when one of their figures is orthogonally
adjacent to the facedown tile. Instead of the figure moving for
that square of movement, the map tile is turned faceup. It is
then oriented so that the arrow at the bottom of the tile points
away from the tile that the figure is on.
The player then looks at the map tile for hut and village icons.
One random hut marker is drawn and placed facedown, without
looking at it, on each square with a hut icon on the map tile.
In addition, one random village marker is drawn and placed
facedown, without looking at it, on each square with a village
icon on it on the map tile.
For example, the red army figure below spends one square of
movement to discover the facedown tile to its right.
The facedown tile is flipped faceup and oriented so that the
white arrow on its edge points away from the tile that the red
army figure is on.
After the tile is flipped over, the player draws a hut and a village
token and, without looking at their other side, places them
facedown on the indicated squares on the tile.
The diagram below shows how the white arrow should appear
when exploring in any of the four directions from the center tile.
Exploring Huts and Villages
Scout figures cannot enter a square containing a hut or village
marker. An army figure that enters a square containing a hut
or village marker must immediately end its movement and is
considered to be exploring the hut or village.
If the marker is a hut, it is peacefully absorbed by the invading
civilization. The player takes the hut marker, looks at it, and then
places it facedown on their civilization sheet. Hut markers have
resources printed on their backs and may be spent like resource
tokens taken from the market, except that they are returned to
the box after being spent, rather than being added to the market.
If the marker is a village, it attempts to repel the invading
civilization. The player to the left of the invading player
becomes the "barbarian player" and draws one artillery, one
infantry, and one mounted unit from the respective decks (if
one or more of the decks are depleted, make up the difference
from one of the other decks  barbarian player's choice). These
three units are barbarians and must be kept separate from
the barbarian player's own units. A battle then takes place
between the barbarian player (using only the barbarian units)
and the invading player. The barbarian player is the defender,
and barbarian units are always rank 1 (Archer, Spearman, or
Horseman). For full details on resolving battles, see "Combat"
on page 23.
After the battle, if the invading player won, that
player takes the village marker and looks at it. If it
shows a great person icon, the player discards the
village marker and then gains a random great person.
Otherwise, the village marker shows a resource and
is placed facedown on the player's civilization sheet,
where it acts like a hut marker, as explained above.
If the invading player loses the battle, the army figure that
entered the square (or the entire group of figures, if a group
of figures entered) is killed and is returned to the player's
civilization sheet. However, unlike losing a battle to another
player, there is no additional penalty for the loss.
Tip: Attacking barbarians without some sort of advantage
beyond a player's starting units is a risky proposition. It's
advisable for players to build extra units, upgrade their units,
attack with a group of army figures, or go in with an ace up their
sleeve (such as the Metalworking tech and an iron token).
Enemy Figures
Scouts cannot enter a square containing enemy figures. If
an army enters a square containing any enemy figures, its
movement immediately ends. If the square contains only enemy
scouts, the scouts are immediately killed and the attacking player
collects loot as though they had won a battle (see page 25). If
the square contains at least one enemy army, a battle occurs (see
page 23). If the square contains a mix of both enemy armies and
scouts, a battle occurs, but if the losing side in the battle has any
scouts in the square, they are killed along with the armies; loot is
then collected as normal.
Example: An army enters a square containing two armies and
a scout. A battle occurs, with the attacking player emerging
triumphant. The two armies and the scout are all killed, and the
attacker receives loot for killing figures.
Friendly and Enemy Cities
A player may move their figures through their own city centers,
but they may not end any figure's movement in their city center.
Scouts may enter enemy city outskirts, but they cannot enter
enemy city centers. Armies may enter enemy city outskirts.
They may also enter an enemy city center, but doing so
immediately results in an attack on the city (see page 23).
5. Research
"All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.
All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life,
lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading
the individual towards freedom."
Albert Einstein
As new technologies are discovered by a civilization, new
avenues and opportunities open up as well. From Pottery to
Space Flight, these advances have the potential to profoundly
change civilizations. During the Research Phase, players may
acquire these technologies, which are represented by tech cards.
In this phase, each player may choose to research one tech card.
Each tech card has a name (A), an icon (B), a level (C), and one
to three abilities (D).
To research a tech, a player must meet the minimum trade
cost for the tech and have a legal space in their civilization's
tech pyramid (see next page). If they meet both requirements,
the player places the chosen tech card facedown in their tech
pyramid. Once all players have chosen their tech cards for the
turn, all researched tech cards are revealed simultaneously.
Tech learned by a player only applies to that player. Just because
Rome learns Engineering doesn't mean that Egypt learns it
as well. Each player must research tech cards for their tech
pyramids individually.

Trade Cost
A player must have a certain minimum amount of trade on
their trade dial in order to research a tech, depending on the
tech's level. A player needs at least 6 trade to research a level I
tech. This threshold is indicated on the players' trade dials by
replacing the number 6 with a "I" to represent tech level I. It
costs an additional 5 trade for each level thereafter (11 for level
II, 16 for level III, 21 for level IV, and 26 for level V). These
higher tech levels are marked on the trade dial in the same way.
Researching a tech spends all of the player's remaining trade,
no matter how much trade they had before researching. The
only exception to this rule is for players who possess coins.
Coins allow a player to retain 1 trade after researching for
each coin the player possesses. Having coins never increases a
player's current trade; it only allows a player to retain trade they
already have. For a full explanation of coins, see page 26.
Example 1: A player wishes to research Sailing, a level II tech.
Looking at the trade dial, they see that level II techs require at
least 11 trade. Fortunately, the player has 18 trade (and a legal
space on their tech pyramid), so they reduce their trade to 0 and
learn Sailing.
Example 2: If the player from example 1 possessed four coins,
they would retain 4 trade after learning Sailing.
The Tech Pyramid
The second requirement a player must meet to learn a new
tech is to have a legal space in their tech pyramid to place the
new tech. Level I tech cards may always be legally placed in a
player's tech pyramid, and indeed, they form the bottom row
of the pyramid. However, when a player learns a level II tech,
it must be placed above two level I tech cards already in their
pyramid. Similarly, level III tech cards must be placed above
two level II tech cards in their pyramid, and so on. Lower-level
tech cards represent the foundation for higher-level techs. As
a player's tech pyramid grows, it resembles a real pyramid, as
shown below and in the "Tech Pyramid" sidebar on page 11.
Level III
Level IV
Level V
Level II
Level I
The highest level tech is Space Flight, at level V. If a player
learns this tech, they immediately win the game with a tech
victory. It is worth noting that the fewest level I tech cards a
player must know to reach level V is five (and a minimum of 15
techs overall is required for a tech victory, see page 22).
Exception: A civilization's starting tech is always placed in the
bottom row of its tech pyramid regardless of its actual level.
Tech Card Abilities
Each tech that a player learns gives them certain benefits, which
could be to unlock certain items for production, upgrade existing
items or abilities, or provide new abilities. These benefits of tech
cards are explained in more detail in the next few sections.
Unlocking Units, Buildings, and Governments
When a player learns a tech showing a new unit type, building,
or government, they immediately gain the ability to produce that
unit or building or to change to that government. This is known
as unlocking the item. At the start of the game, all figures, the
three basic unit types (artillery, infantry, and mounted), and the
Despotism government are unlocked. Everything else must be
unlocked through researching tech.
Example: The Code of Laws tech (shown below) unlocks the
Trading Post building (lower-right of the card) and the Republic
government (upper-right), allowing the player to produce Trading
Posts and change to a Republic government.
Upgrading Units
When a player learns a tech with a unit upgrade on it, they check
to see if they already know a better upgrade for that unit type.
If not, they find the military tech marker for their improved unit
type and place it below the appropriate unit deck on the market
board to show that their units of that type have been upgraded
(or flip the current marker over if the new rank is on the back).
Note: Rank 2 is on the back of each rank 1 military tech marker,
and rank 3 and rank 4 (marked with a star) are the front and back
of a second military tech marker.
For example, when a player learns Chivalry, they check to see
if their mounted unit military tech marker is already better
than rank 2 (indicated by the two stripes). If not, they flip their
mounted military tech marker to the rank 2 side.
All units of that type that the player has already produced are
automatically upgraded immediately. However, once a player
has upgraded a unit, they must now pay the new, higher cost to
produce new units of that type.
Continuing the example above, now that the player's mounted
units are Knights, it costs 7 ! instead of 5 ! to produce new
mounted units, but any mounted units the player already has are
automatically upgraded to Knights.

Upgrading Buildings
Some buildings have a basic and an upgraded form, such as the
Granary (basic) and the Aqueduct (upgraded). These buildings
are printed on the front and back of the same markers. Looking
at the market board, upgraded buildings have an arrow next to
their names. When a player learns a tech unlocking an upgraded
building, they immediately flip over any of the corresponding
basic buildings that they've already produced in their cities.
So, for example, when a player learns Engineering, which
unlocks Aqueducts, they flip over any Granaries they've already
produced, immediately upgrading them to Aqueducts.
However, as with upgrading units, once a player has unlocked
the upgraded version of a building, they can no longer produce
the basic version of the building and must now produce the new,
higher-cost building.
Continuing the example above, once a player learns Engineering,
they can no longer produce Granaries for 5 ! , but must now
produce the more expensive Aqueducts for 8 ! .
Note: A player does not need to know the tech that unlocks the
basic form of a building in order to learn the tech that unlocks
the upgraded form of that building.
Resource Abilities
Many tech cards, such as Currency, have abilities on them that
require the player to spend resource tokens to use the abilities.
These abilities are called resource abilities. Each resource
ability has (A) a picture of the resource or resources required to
use it (with a question mark meaning any resource of the player's
choice), (B) the phase in which the ability may be used, and (C)
the actual ability itself.
For example, Currency (shown above) allows a player to spend
one incense resource token to gain three culture tokens during
the player's City Management Phase.
Each given resource ability may only be used once per
turn, regardless of how many resource tokens a player has.
However, if a player knows several techs with similar resource
abilities (such as Currency and Chivalry), then each may be used
once per turn.
Other Abilities
Other abilities that can be granted by tech cards include
improved traits such as travel speed (Horseback Riding) or
maximum number of armies (Masonry) and constant abilities
such as the ability to split a city's production to produce two
items (Engineering). A key to all of the icons found on tech cards
can be found on the back cover of this rulebook.
Winning the Game
As briefly mentioned earlier, there are four ways to win Sid
Meier's Civilization: The Board Game. Each method requires a
civilization to focus on a different aspect of the game to achieve
greatness.
Culture Victory
A culture victory is attained by spending enough culture and
trade to advance to the end of the culture track on the market
board (see page 1718). As soon as a player advances to the space
marked "Culture Victory," that player wins the game.
A player wishing to win with a culture victory should
concentrate on adding culture icons to their cities and devoting
their cities to the arts. Later on, the player will also need to
make sure their cities are producing enough trade as well. Techs
that unlock culture-producing buildings (such as Theology) or
which have incense-powered abilities (such as Currency) are
most useful for this type of victory. Certain culture-producing
wonders, such as Stonehenge, are also helpful.
Tech Victory
A tech victory is achieved upon researching the Space Flight
tech, which is the only level 5 tech in the game. It takes a
minimum of five level 1 techs, four level 2 techs, three level 3
techs, and two level 4 techs to research Space Flight, meaning
that a tech victory requires a minimum of 15 techs.
A player wishing to win with a tech victory should concentrate
on adding trade icons to their cities and finding ways to
research more than once a turn (such as through culture event
cards). Techs that unlock trade-producing buildings (such as
Code of Laws) or which have trade-producing abilities (such
as Horseback Riding) are most useful for this type of victory.
Certain wonders that help research, such as the Statue of Liberty,
are also useful.
Economic Victory
An economic victory is completed by accumulating 15 coins on
the player's economic dial. Coins are either gained from squares
on the map and building (see "Coins on the Map," page 26) or
from techs (see "Coin Tokens" on page 26).
A player wishing to win with an economic victory should dabble
in a variety of different aspects of the game, including trade,
resources, combat, and culture. While some coins can be gained
from buildings (such as Banks), a number of the player's coins
will have to come from doing different tasks, as stated on certain
techs. Pottery, Code of Laws, Printing Press, and Democracy all
allow a player to gain coins by completing particular tasks. In
addition, certain wonders, such as the Panama Canal, are helpful
in accumulating coins.
Military Victory
A military victory is achieved by conquering another player's
capital city (see "Combat," below). This requires the player to
build up their military forces and technology.
A player wishing to win with a military victory should increase
their military power. This includes building a supply of units and
upgrading them with techs (such as Gunpowder), raising their
figure stacking limit (such as with Biology), and accumulating
other strength bonuses for combat (such as from Academies).
Military players should beware of culture events and may find
certain wonders such as Himeji Samurai Castle to be helpful.
Other Rules
This section contains additional rules to the game.

COMBAT:
"The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of
speeches and majority decisions...but by iron and blood."
Otto von Bismarck
Battle is the struggle of one civilization against another
for dominance. When an army figure moves into a square
containing a village marker, an enemy army figure, or an
enemy city, a battle takes place. The player whose army figure
is entering the square is the attacker, while the player whose
figure or city is being attacked is the defender. If the attacker
is attacking a village, the player to the attacker's left becomes
the defender. Generally, the defender is placed at a slight
disadvantage in a battle, since the element of surprise is on the
attacker's side. When a battle begins, the attacker and defender
take the following steps:
1. Assembling the Batt le Force
The attacker and defender each shuffle their standing forces and
draw a number of unit cards equal to their battle hand size at
random. A player's battle hand size starts at three and may be
increased in the following ways:
+2 hand size for each friendly a  rmy figure in the square
beyond the first (remember that players cannot exceed their
civilization's stacking limit)
 +1 hand size if governed by Fundamentalism
 +3 hand size if defending a city or capital.
A unit card has four different sides, as shown below. Each side
has a unit name (A), military rank (B), strength value (C), trump
symbol (D), and unit type (E).

When using a unit card in battle, a player only uses the side
corresponding to the rank of their matching military tech
marker. For instance, if the player's mounted military tech
marker is set to rank 2 (the side with two stripes), that player
only pays attention to the rank 2 side of their mounted units  in
this case, the "Knight" side. For example, the unit below would
have a strength of 2:
Note: The first three ranks of military tech are represented with
one, two, or three stripes, while the fourth rank is represented by
a star.
After a player draws their battle force, they may wish to turn
their cards so that each card is oriented such that the top edge is
the one they are using, as indicated by the unit's rank. A player's
battle force cards are held in hand and kept secret from their
opponent until played during battle.
Tip 1: A player's battle hand size is one of the best indicators of
strength in battle, but only if the player actually has enough units
in their standing forces to make use of it. Players should always
try to keep their number of units in their standing forces at or
above their expected battle hand size.
Tip 2: Just as having too few units can be dangerous, it can also
be bad to have too many units. Since a player's battle force is
selected at random from their standing forces, having too many
units reduces the player's chances of drawing the units they
really want in battle.
2. Calculating Combat Bonuses
Next, the players look to see if either side has any combat
bonuses. If so, the player with the highest combat bonus takes
the combat bonus card and places it in front of them, turned so
that it is set to their combat bonus minus their opponent's combat
bonus. For instance, if one player has a bonus of +12 and the
other player has a bonus of +8, the first player receives a combat
bonus card turned to its +4 side. The available combat bonuses
are as follows:
 +2 for every Barracks the player has built
 +4 for every Academy the player has built
 +4 for every Great General the player has on the map
 +6 if defending a non-capital city
 +12 if defending a capital city
 +4 if defending a walled capital or non-capital city (stacks
with either of the two other city bonuses).
Tip: Every +4 in combat bonuses a player has is equivalent to
approximately one unit. Although unit strength varies over the
course of the game, this is an easy and reasonably accurate rule
of thumb for players to remember.
23
3. Engaging in Battle
Now, starting with the defender, then alternating back and forth,
each player must play a unit from their battle force faceup on the
table between them until both players have played all of the units
in their battle forces.
Exception: If the attacker is attacking a walled city, the attacker
must play the first unit rather than the defender.
When a player plays the first unit in battle, this creates what is
called the first front. After that, each time a player plays a unit,
they must either start a new front or attack an existing enemy
front (if any exist to attack).
Starting a New Front
Starting a new front is simply playing a unit without attacking
another unit. The newly played unit remains in play until killed
or until the end of the battle. There can never be more than one
unit in a front.
Example 1: Below, player A has a strength 3 mounted unit
in play. Player B, not wanting to attack it, plays a strength 2
mounted unit below it in a new front. Since there are no other
units in either front, no attacks occur.
Player B
Player A
Attacking an Enemy Front
To attack an existing front, the player places their unit card in
front of a faceup enemy unit already played in this battle. The
two unit cards then immediately attack each other. Each unit
card deals a number of wounds equal to its strength to the
other unit. Any unit that suffers wounds equal to its strength
is immediately killed and returned faceup to the bottom of the
unit deck it was originally acquired from. If a unit survives
the attack, wound tokens are placed on the card to indicate the
damage. All wounds go away at the end of the battle.
Example 2: This time, player B's strength 2 unit is in play first.
Player A, having a strength 3 unit in hand, plays their unit into
the strength 2 unit's front, attacking it. The strength 3 unit
deals three wounds to the weaker unit, killing it, and suffers
two wounds in return. This damage is not enough to kill the
strength 3 unit, so two wound tokens are placed on it to record
the damage. Should this unit survive until the end of the battle, it
will then fully heal.
Player B
Player A
Even if a unit was previously wounded, it still inflicts its full
strength in wounds to any unit that attacks it.
Example 3: After killing the strength 2 unit in example 3, player
A's wounded strength 3 unit is attacked by another strength 3 unit
played by player B. Although it still has two wounds, player A's
unit still deals its full damage to player B's unit. In this instance,
both units are killed, since each deals three wounds to the other.
Player B
Player A
One of the key military concepts in Sid Meier's
Civilization: The Board Game is the difference between
armies and units.
Armies are plastic figures that move around the map,
indicating the presence of a player's military forces.
However, without units, armies have no strength and the
player is extremely unlikely to win a battle.
Units are square cards that are used to resolve battles.
Units represent the strength of a player's military forces.
However, units have no physical location on the map and
cannot be used outside a player's cities without an army.
Thus, a player needs both armies and units to succeed at a
military victory.
Armies vs. Units
Trumping Units
Not all unit types are equally capable against all other unit
types. In fact, there is a rock-paper-scissors relationship between
artillery, infantry, and mounted units, as shown below:
This relationship is shown on the unit cards by their trump
symbols. For example, infantry units are particularly effective
against mounted units (e.g., pikemen versus knights), so infantry
units have the mounted unit symbol as their trump symbol.
When a unit attacks or is attacked by a unit that it has pictured
on its card as a trump symbol, it trumps that unit, dealing its
damage before the other unit can do so. If this damage kills the
trumped unit, the trumped unit deals no damage back to the unit
trumping it, since it is already dead before it can deal its damage.
Example 4: In example 3, previously, if player B's attacking
strength 3 unit was an infantry unit, it would trump player A's
wounded unit. Thus, player B's unit would deal its 3 wounds
first, killing the wounded unit before it could attack back, and
would survive the attack without suffering a single wound.
Player B
Player A
TRUMP
Tip: Obviously, a player whose units are trumped frequently
during a battle is at a serious disadvantage. Players should
observe what units other players are producing and react
accordingly.
Battle Abilities
Some tech cards have resource abilities that are used during
battle. These abilities are always used before or after attacking
an enemy front, never during  even if some of their effects may
last through an attack.
Aircraft Units
If a player learns the Flight tech, they become capable of
producing aircraft units. Aircraft units are very powerful units
(their strength ranges from 5 to 7) that cannot trump or be
trumped by any unit. This means that aircraft units reliably deal
their damage, no matter what enemies they are faced with.
4. Resolving the Battle
After both players have played all of their battle forces, the battle
is over. First, all wounds are removed from the surviving units in
the battle. Then, each player tallies up the strength of all of their
surviving units, adding in the value of the combat bonus card (if
they have it). The player with the highest total wins the battle,
with ties going to the defender.
Winner's Figure Losses
The winner then loses one army figure in the square for every
two units of theirs that were killed in the battle. A player's last
army figure in the square can never be lost this way.
Winner's Loot
The winner of the battle receives a reward depending on the
loser's circumstances in the battle.
If the loser had one or more figures in the square:
The loser's figures in that square are all killed and are removed
from the board (although they may be built again later). The
winner may then take their choice of one of the following from
the loser:
Up to three points of trade f  rom the loser's trade dial
 Up to three culture tokens
 Any one resource token (facedown hut and village tokens
may be chosen, but the winner does not get to see what they
are before choosing).
If the loser was defending one of their non-capital cities:
The loser's city is destroyed. Its city marker is returned to its
owner's civilization sheet. Any buildings in its outskirts are
returned to the market, and any wonders or great people in its
outskirts are returned to the box and removed from the game.
The winner's figures remain in the square where the city center
was, and the winner then gets to do one of the following:
 Learn one of the loser's known techs that the winner does not
know, without having to pay the trade cost. The winner must
have a legal spot in their tech pyramid to do so (see page 21).
 Steal one of the loser's culture event cards. The winner only
gets to look at the card backs when choosing.
 Steal up to any two resource tokens from the loser. Facedown
hut and village tokens may be chosen, but the winner does
not get to see what they are before choosing.
If the loser was defending their capital city:
 The winner immediately wins the game with a military
victory.
Tip: Since the first player to conquer a capital city wins the game,
players must be careful not to weaken their opponents too much
when there are other hostile armies near that player's capital.

INFANTRY MOUNTED
ARTILLERY
Aftermath
If the game isn't over, any surviving units (whether owned by the
winner or the loser) are then returned to their owner's standing
forces. Any killed units are placed faceup on the bottom of their
respective unit decks.
Tip: Winning a battle against a powerful defender such as a
capital city or a strong military player requires a mix of increases
to the player's battle hand size, upgrades to the player's units,
combat bonuses, and enough unit cards to fill up their hand.
However, the rewards for successful attacks are very significant,
and the outcome of the entire game can be turned around by a
canny military maneuver.
Coins and Economic Power
"Don't tell me where your priorities are. Show me where you
spend your money and I'll tell you what they are."
James W. Frick
Although a leader may have great ambitions for their
civilization, ultimately very little can be accomplished without
the industry of the people working with the bounty of the land to
create a healthy economy. A player may acquire economic power
in the form of coins  either coins printed on building markers
and map tiles, or coin tokens placed on certain tech cards (such
as Code of Laws) as a reward for accomplishing particular tasks.
When a player gains a coin, they advance their economy dial.
Should the player later lose the coin, their economy dial must be
reduced accordingly.
Coins have two primary effects. First, when a player researches
a tech, they may keep one trade for every coin they have. So, for
instance, a player with five coins would be left with five trade
after researching a tech. Coins do not allow a player to keep
trade after any event other than researching a tech. Therefore,
a player can still have their trade reduced below their number
of coins when spending trade to rush production or when trade
is taken after the loss of a battle. It should be noted that having
coins never increases a player's current trade  it merely allows
the player to retain the trade they have already accumulated.
The second major effect that coins have is that a player who
accumulates 15 coins immediately wins the game with an
economic victory (see "Winning the Game" on page 22).
Other abilities may be granted to a player by certain tech cards,
such as Computers, based on the number of coins they have
accumulated.
Coins on the Map
Coins gained from squares on the map  whether from a natural
gold deposit in the mountains or from a building placed in a
square  are only kept as long as the player retains control of the
square (i.e., the square is contained in the outskirts of one of the
player's cities or one of the player's scouts remains in the square
to gather from it). If an enemy figure blockades the square
containing the coin, it is lost while the enemy figure remains
there (see page 27). Similarly, if a building granting a coin to a
player is destroyed, the coin is lost.
Coin Tokens
Coin tokens placed on a tech card as a reward for accomplishing
a certain task are treated just like coins on the map, except that
there is a maximum number of times a given task will provide a
coin token. Coin tokens advance the economy dial when gained
and cannot be lost.
Scout Gathering
Scouts are of vital importance to a player's civilization. One of
their critical roles is to send home trade, production, culture,
coins, and resources from distant locations. Each turn, beginning
the turn after it was placed on the map, a scout gathers the
contents of the square it occupies. The player declares which of
their cities the scout is "sending" the square to during the Start
of Turn Phase, and all of the icons in that square (including
trade, production, culture, coins, and resources) are then
considered to be in that city's outskirts for the rest of the turn.
Consequently, the city benefits from any trade, production, or
other icons in the square for the turn.
The city above contains the following icons:
Thus, it adds 3 @ to the red player's trade dial each turn during
the Trade Phase. During City Management, its action may be
used to do one of the following three things:
 Produce an item that costs 5 ! or less
 Generate 1 # (1 for the city, plus 0 additional # symbols)
 Harvest either a silk or an incense resource token.
For a full explanation of how that was determined, see
"Collecting Trade" on page 14, and "City Management" on
pages 1518.
Example 1: A scout in a forest sends its square to the
previously discussed city, increasing the city's production by
two for the turn.
Example 2: A scout in a natural wonder sends the square to
the previously discussed city. That turn, the city devotes itself
to culture. Because the city gains the symbols of the square the
scout is in, the city produces one more culture token than normal
(two total).
Note that, in this example, although the city still receives the two
extra production from the forest, it doesn't matter because the
city devotes itself to the arts for its action rather than production.
Example 3: A scout in a square with a wheat resource icon sends
the square to the previously discussed city. That turn, that city
harvests a resource and may choose to harvest a wheat, silk, or
incense resource since the scout's space is considered part of the
city's outskirts.
Blockades
Enemy forces, properly placed, can prevent a city from obtaining
some of the supplies it is used to obtaining. Thus, a square in a
city's outskirts that contains one or more enemy figures (either
scouts or armies) does not generate production, trade, culture,
coins, or resources for the city's owner. A square may be
blockaded even if it contains a building or a great person.
Wonders are not immune to blockades either. While an enemy
figure remains in the same square as a wonder's marker, the
special ability on the wonder's card cannot be used and the
culture produced by its marker cannot be collected.
Buildings, wonders, great people, and scouts cannot be placed
in a blockaded square after being produced. Army figures may
be placed in a blockaded square, but doing so immediately
results in a battle, with the blockading player as the defender (see
"Combat" on page 23).
A scout may gather icons in a blockaded square in the outskirts
of an enemy city. In this case, the square is considered to be a
part of the city the scout is sending it to for the turn rather than
the city being blockaded.
Example: An enemy scout is in a forest in the outskirts of the
city discussed earlier and sends the square to one of the scout's
own cities. For that turn, the production of the scout's city is
increased by two and the production of the city being blockaded
is reduced by two.
Obsoleting Wonders
"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!"
Ozymandias, Percy Bysshe Shelley
Certain techs (Monarchy and Gunpowder) allow a player to
obsolete a wonder. When a wonder is obsoleted, turn its wonder
card facedown, but leave its wonder marker on the map. The
wonder's special ability is negated and cannot be used for the
rest of the game. However, the wonder marker still produces
culture when the city it is in is devoted to the arts.

Rules Summary 24

OVERVIEW:
Odin All-Father, in his wisdom, always
knew Ragnark would come. He never
found a way to prevent the destruction of
Midgard. Lesser creatures can only cower
and wait for the end.
But not you. You are a Viking, leader of a
proud and ancient clan. Even in the face
of final doom for all the world, you will
command your warriors on the field of
battle, conquering and pillaging as you
were born to do. The gods are generous in
their twilight hours, bestowing gifts and
boons upon you. Even the most monstrous
creatures of Midgard seek to find glory in
the little time they have left, and so they
too may join you in your assault. You will
use everything you have left to earn your
place in Valhalla by besting all other clans,
achieving the last victory the world will
ever know.
Life is fleeting, but glory is eternal. Now is
the time for rage!

OBJECTIVE:
The goal of the game is to achieve the greatest amount of
glory before the world finally comes to its fiery end. You
gain glory through victory in battle, through pillaging,
accomplishing quests for the gods, and dying valiantly in
battle. The game progresses through three Ages, as Ragnark
slowly consumes the world. The player with the
most glory at the end is the winner.

GAME BOARD:
The Blood Rage game board is a map of the mythical terrain
around Yggdrasil, the great tree that binds the nine
worlds together. The land is divided into nine provinces.
The center province is Yggdrasil. There are eight outer
provinces around it, divided into three regions: Manheim,
Alfheim, and Jotunheim. Provinces that share a
border are considered adjacent (Yggdrasil is adjacent to
all the other provinces).
Each of the provinces has three to five villages. Each village
can hold a single plastic figure. Because of this, each province
can only have as many figures within its borders as it
has villages. Yggdrasil has no villages, and so there is no
limit to the number of figures that can occupy Yggdrasil.
In addition, there are four fjords situated between pairs of
outer provinces. Each fjord is said to be supporting the two
provinces that it is connected to. Any effect that affects a
province, also affects its supporting fjord. There is no limit
to the number of Ship figures that can occupy each fjord.
Finally, there is the Glory Track running around the
edge of the board to keep track of the players' scores.
Each player will move his clan's Glory marker along this
track whenever they gain more Glory.

BASIC CONCEPTS:
Each of the clans the players can choose to play as has
its own clan sheet in order to keep track of its resources,
stats and upgrades.
Across the middle of your clan sheet is your Rage Track.
Rage is your currency. When you take actions, it will
usually cost you some of your Rage. You will move your
clan token along this track to indicate how much Rage
you have left at the moment.
Below the Rage Track are your clan's stats. These are
Rage, Axes, and Horns.
The Rage stat tells you how much Rage you will have at
your disposal at the beginning of each round. With more
Rage, you can take more actions.
The Axes stat tells you how much Glory you gain for
winning battles. With more Axes, your victories in battle
will be more glorious, spurring your clan farther on your
path to victory.
The Horns stat tells you how many figures you can have
on the board at a time. With greater numbers, you can
fight more battles, pillage more lands and shed more
blood.
As the game goes on, you'll have several opportunities to
increase each of your clan's stats. Whenever one of your
stats is increased by one step, move the respective clan
token one slot to the right. If you're able to increase your
stats to legendary levels by the end of the game, you'll
gain powerful glory bonuses.
Each of your figures  Leader, Ship, Warriors, and eventually
Monsters  has a Strength rating (STR). At the
start of the game, these ratings are all shown on your
clan sheet: Leaders have STR 3, Ships have STR 2, and
Warriors have STR 1. Having plenty of strength on the
board will help you win battles and fulfill quests.
In addition, Leaders and Ships start the game with special
abilities, as detailed on the clan sheet.
As the game progresses, you may upgrade your figures
by placing Upgrade cards on the appropriate slot on your
clan sheet. These cards will tell you your figures' new
STR rating and abilities. Note that Leaders and Ships
still retain the abilities detailed on the clan sheet, even
if they are upgraded.
Whenever a figure is destroyed, be it in battle, victim of
a special ability, or by the inescapable doom of Ragnark,
it is placed on the Valhalla sheet that sits next to the
board. There it waits for the next Age to rejoin the battle.
Cards
Three decks of cards are included that represent the gifts
of the Norse gods. Each round of the game will introduce
a new deck. These gifts can help in a wide variety of ways.
Battle cards (red) add to your army's Strength in battle.
Quest cards (green) represent divine quests given to your
clan. If successful, they can grant you a lot of glory.
Upgrade cards (black) upgrade several aspects of your clan:
 Troop upgrades upgrade the strength and/or abilities
of your Warriors, Leader or Ship.
 Monster upgrades are unique mythological beings
you can recruit to join you in battle.
 Clan upgrades are upgrades for your clan as a
whole that offer a variety of different effects.

Prepare Your Clan
First, each player chooses one of the available clans to play,
by placing one of the Clan Sheets in front of them. At the
start of the game, all clans are equal, but they'll soon become
unique with each player's choice of upgrades.
Take your clan's Leader figure and 8 Warrior figures, and
make sure the small plastic bases in your clan's color are
attached to them. This helps easily distinguish your units
on the board. Take one Ship figure and make sure it's got
a sail attached in your clan's color. Keep all of your figures
near your clan sheet. This area is called your reserve.
Also keep your clan's extra 2 small bases and 2 large bases
next to you. They will be used if you recruit any Monsters.
Take your clan's Glory Marker and place it on the Glory
Track around the board, on the "0" spot.
Take all of your Clan Tokens, placing one of them on the
first spot of each of the three Clan Stats on your clan
sheet: Rage, Axes, and Horns. This means all players start
the game with the following stats: 6 Rage, 3 Axes, and 4
Horns. Finally take your last Clan token and place it on
the Rage Track on your clan sheet. Since your starting
Rage stat is 6, the token is placed on the "6" spot of your
Rage Track.

Prepare the Board
Next to the Game Board, place the Valhalla sheet and
the Age Track sheet.
Take all the Pillage tokens and place the one with the
green border on the Yggdrasil province at the center of
the board, with the reward side facing up. Shuffle the
other 8 Pillage tokens and place them randomly on the
other 8 provinces surrounding Yggdrasil, face up. The
Pillage tokens show the reward you get for pillaging that
province, as explained on page 18.
Take the 8 Ragnark tokens and shuffle them. Place one
on each of the three Ragnark spots on the Age Track.
The tokens should have the text side facing up, indicating
what provinces will be destroyed in the course of the
game.
As a constant reminder of which province is doomed to
be swallowed next by Ragnark, place the Doom token
on the province indicated by the Ragnark token on the
First Age track.
Before the game begins, some provinces will already have
been destroyed by Ragnark, leaving less usable space on
the board. Depending on the number of players in the
game, randomly take the number of Ragnark tokens indicated
below and place them on the provinces indicated
on them, with the "destroyed" side facing up.
 In a 4-player game, 1 province is destroyed.
 In a 3-player game, 2 provinces are destroyed.
 In a 2-player game, 3 provinces are destroyed.
The remaining Ragnark tokens are placed back in the
box. A province with a Ragnark token on it is effectively
out of the game. No figures can ever be placed in that
province.

GAME SETUP:
Prepare the Cards
Separate the cards by their card backs, creating three different
decks: 1, 2, and 3.
Depending on how many people are playing the game,
some cards may need to be removed from each deck to
make sure the game is balanced properly. The cards that
may need to be removed show on the left side a small
number, such as 3+, or 4+. This indicates that the card
should only be included when playing with the indicated
number of players or more.
 For a 4-player game, no cards are removed.
 For a 3-player game, all 4+ cards are removed.
 For a 2-player game, all 3+ and 4+ cards are removed.
Each deck contains eight 4+ cards and six 3+ cards. Any removed
cards are placed back in the game box. Then, shuffle
each of the three decks separately and place them, face
down, on the appropriate Gods' Gifts spots of the Age Track.
Last Steps
Place all Monster figures next to the board, within reach
of all players
Place the Saga token on the first spot of the First Age on
the Story Track. This is the "Gods' Gifts  Age 1" spot. The
Saga token will be moved from phase to phase of each
Age, one Age after the other, in order to help players keep
track as the game progresses.
Finally, give the First Player token to the player who
was born furthest to the north. That player will start
the game in the First Age. The First Player token will be
passed to the player to the left at the end of each Age.

Blood Rage is played over a series of three rounds, known
as Ages. Each Age is divided into six phases:
1. GODS' GIFTS
2. ACTION
3. DISCARD
4. QUEST
5. RAGNARK
6. RELEASE VALHALLA
The phases must be played in order, and a phase must be
completely finished before moving to the next one. Move
the Saga token on the Age Track from one phase to the
next as they are completed, to help keep track. Once the
last phase of an Age is done, the Saga token is moved to
the first phase of the next Age, until it reaches the end of
the Third Age and the game ends.
Gods' Gifts Phase
During this phase, players build a hand of cards in a process
called drafting. These cards will provide them with
upgrades for troops and clan, monsters to join the fight,
quests for glory, and the raw power to win battles.
On the Second and Third Age, if a player has a leftover
card in their hand from a previous Age, they must first
place this card face down on their clan sheet, on top of
their clan symbol.
Take the deck of cards from the Age Track of the current
Age and deal 8 cards to each player. The few remaining
cards won't be used in this game session.
Drafting works like this: Each player inspects the eight
cards dealt to them and selects one to keep, placing it
face down on their clan sheet, on top of the symbol of
their clan animal. Once everyone has placed a card on
their clan sheet, everyone passes the rest of their cards to
the player on their left.

FIRST GAME:
For your First Age, we recommend you simply play
with the 8 cards you're dealt, and don't draft. After
one Age, players should be familiar enough to draft
during the Second Age.

THE PHASES OF PLAY:
Now each player looks at the cards they've been passed,
selects one to keep, and places it face down on their
clan sheet. Then everyone passes their remaining cards
to the left.
Continue picking and passing cards until each player has
placed six new cards on their clan sheet. By that point, everyone
will have two cards left to pass. But instead of passing
them, they must be discarded without showing them.
At the end of this phase, all players should have 6 cards
in their hand, plus any card they might have saved from
a previous Age. Keep these cards secret from the other
players. You will be able to use these cards during the
Action phase.
Act ion Phase
This is the main part of the game, where invading and pillaging
takes place, battles are fought, and blood is spilled.
All players begin the Action phase with the amount of
Rage indicated by the Rage stat on their clan sheet. If
this is the first Age, you've already taken care of this by
placing your Clan token at 6 Rage during setup. In subsequent
Ages, if you have improved your clan's Rage stat,
you will begin the Action phase with more Rage.
Example: The Raven player has improved his Rage stat two
steps during the previous Age, so he begins the next Action
phase with 8 Rage.
The player with the First Player token will go first, and
play proceeds in clockwise order from there.
On your turn, you must choose a single action to perform.
If that action carries a cost in Rage (it usually does), you
must pay that cost and then take your action. Move the
token on you clan's Rage Track to indicate how much Rage
you've spent. If you do not have enough Rage to fully pay
for a particular action, you cannot take that action.
Once your action is complete, your turn ends. The player
to your left will then take their turn, performing a single
action and paying any Rage cost associated with it. Players
continue taking turns in order.
DRAFTING IN A 2-PLAYER GAME
Drafting is a little different in a 2-player game.
Players select 2 cards to keep (instead of 1), placing
them face down on their clan sheet, and pass the rest
to their opponent. This is done two more times until
each player has placed 6 cards on their clan sheet.
Then the remaining 2 cards are discarded.
STRATEGY TIPS FOR DRAFTING
Most cards are named after a specific god, with each
god providing a different kind of gift. If you stick mostly
to cards named after one or two gods, you should do
well. Here's what you can expect from each god:
Odin: Judgment and punishment in and out of battle.
Thor: Glory and spoils for victory in battle.
Loki: Revenge or spoils for defeat in battle.
Frigga: Resources and support.
Heimdall: Foresight and surprises.
Tyr: Great numbers for winning battles.
You generally should strive for a relative balance of
card types. Ignoring a card type completely (such as
Quests, Upgrades, or Battle Cards) won't make you
automatically lose, but it may cost you!
The Phases Of Play
A player who is down to zero Rage cannot perform any action
on their turn, not even an action that costs zero Rage.
All that player can do is react to other players' actions, such
as participating in a battle started by another player.
Players have five options to choose from when performing
an action (as indicated at the bottom of the clan
sheet). Players can take the same action several times
throughout an Action phase, always taking a single action
per turn.
If you cannot take an action, or do not wish to, you can
choose to pass. However, when you pass, you lose all your
remaining Rage and can take no further actions.
End of the Action Phase: The Action phase immediately
ends when either all players are down to zero Rage, or
all of the provinces that are not yet destroyed have been
successfully pillaged (even if players still have Rage left).
INVADE
Choose a single figure in your reserve and pay Rage equal
to that figure's STR. Take that figure from your reserve
and place it into any empty village in any outer province.
If the chosen figure is a Ship, it must be placed in any
fjord. You cannot use this action to place a figure directly
in Yggdrasil; to put your troops in Yggdrasil you'll have
to March them there. Also note that invading with your
Leader does not cost any Rage.
Example: The Raven player has upgraded his Warriors. Since
their STR is now 2, he pays 2 Rage in order to Invade the empty
Utgard village with 1 of the Warriors in his reserve.
Note: Always pay attention to your Horns stat. If the
number of your figures on the board is equal to your current
Horns stat, you cannot Invade with any more figures
(Valhalla is not part of the board).
 INVADE: Place a figure from your reserve onto an
empty village on the map.
 MARCH: Move the figures from one province to
empty villages in a different province.
 UPGRADE: Place a card from your hand on your
clan sheet to improve your abilities.
 QUEST: Commit to a quest by placing a Quest card
from your hand face down onto your clan sheet.
 PILLAGE: Attack a province and plunder its bounty
for your clan.
14 The Phases Of Play
MARCH
When you order your troops to March, you must pay 1
Rage. Choose one province (you cannot choose a fjord)
and move any number of your figures from that province
to empty villages in another single province. The destination
province doesn't have to be adjacent, it can be
anywhere on the board.
You cannot move figures from two different provinces in
the same action, nor move your figures to two different
provinces. You can only March from any one province to
any other.
Note: Using the March action is generally the only way
to get your figures to Yggdrasil. There are no villages in
Yggdrasil, so there is no limit to the number of figures
you can have there.
Example: The example below shows five different legal or illegal
March actions:
1: The blue player can move his 2 figures, even though the provinces
are not adjacent. He's unable to move all 3 of his figures
from Gimle because Elvagar only has 2 empty villages.
2: The yellow player can move all the figures he wants from
Angerboda to Yggdrasil. There's no limit to the number of figures
that can occupy Yggdrasil.
3: The brown player cannot move his figures into two different
provinces with a single March action.
4: The red player cannot move his figures from two different
provinces with a single March action.
5: Ships can never be moved.
The Phases Of Play 15
UPGRADE
Each clan sheet has slots for up to eight upgrades: one
each for your Warriors, Leader and Ship, two for Monsters,
and three for your Clan.
When you Upgrade, you must choose an Upgrade card
from your hand and pay Rage equal to that card's STR.
Then place the card in the appropriate slot on your clan
sheet. If there is more than one potential slot, you choose
which one to use. If there is already a card in that slot,
discard the old card and replace it with the new one. This
new Upgrade card is now in permanent effect, granting
you any benefits listed on it; from higher Strength for
your troops to special abilities.
If your clan has two Upgrades in different slots that give
you the same type of benefit, both cards take effect independently.
One does not cancel the other.
Example: In order to play the Loki's Eminence upgrade, the
Serpent player must pay Rage equal to its STR of 2. Since she
already has three Clan Upgrades on her clan sheet, she chooses to
discard Frigga's Succor to make space for the new upgrade. Her
clan now has both Loki's Domain and Loki's Emminence, giving
it a total of 3 Glory for each figure she releases from Valhalla!
TROOP UPGRADES
When you play a Leader, Warrior, or Ship upgrade, if
you have the corresponding figure in your reserve, you
may immediately (before the next player's turn) Invade
with it without spending any extra Rage.
MONSTER UPGRADES
Monsters are unique figures that can dramatically
change the course of the game. Each has a powerful and
unique special ability.
When you play a Monster upgrade, take the corresponding
Monster figure, attach your clan's base to it, and place
it in your reserve. It is now yours for the rest of the game,
counting as one of your figures. You may immediately
Invade with it without spending any extra Rage.
Your Monster can die and be sent to Valhalla like any
other figure, returning to your reserve in the next Release
Valhalla phase. It can gain Glory for you during the
Ragnark phase just like any other figure.
You can only have 2 Monsters as part of your clan at a
time. If you discard a Monster's card in order to place a
new Monster in its Upgrade slot, the old Monster figure
is immediately returned to the game box.
16 The Phases Of Play
QUEST
Take a Quest card from your hand and commit to it by
placing it face down on your clan sheet, on top of your
clan's animal symbol. It costs no Rage to commit to a
Quest. There is no limit to the number of Quests you can
commit to during each Age, and you may commit to two
Quests of the same type (each giving its reward independently).
You may inspect your own Quests at any time.
During this Action phase, you should try to fulfill the
demands of the Quests you commit to, reaping the rewards
listed on them during the next Quest phase (see
page 20). However, there's no penalty for failing a Quest.
Note: Even though it costs no Rage to commit to a Quest,
remember that you cannot take any actions if you're
down to zero Rage; not even a free one.
Example: The Bear player commits to the Jotunheim! Quest.
If during the next Quest phase he has the most STR in any of
the Jotunheim provinces, he'll gain 7 Glory and raise one of his
clan stats 1 step.
PILLAGE
If you successfully Pillage a province, you will gain a reward,
either by improving one of your clan stats, or by
gaining more glory. But first you will need to defeat in
battle any other clans occupying that province.
To Pillage, choose a province that has at least one of
your figures in it (or in a supporting fjord) and has not
yet been successfully pillaged this phase (its Pillage token
is showing the reward side up). It costs no Rage to
Pillage, but remember that you can't take any action if
you're down to zero Rage. A Pillaging action is resolved
by following 3 steps in order:
1. CALL TO BATTLE
Once you have declared your intent to Pillage that province,
the other players have a chance to join the battle.
Starting with the player to your left and going around in
clockwise order, each player (including you) may, if they
wish, move one of their figures from an adjacent province
into an empty village in the province you are pillaging.
Moving a figure in this way does not cost Rage, and even
players with zero Rage can do it. (Note that Ships cannot
be moved.) Once all villages in that province are occupied,
or when no one else wishes to join in, the battle begins.
Note: There are no villages in Yggdrasil, so any number of
figures can join a battle there.
If at this point there are no enemy figures in the province
or its supporting fjord, no battle takes place and you automatically
Pillage the province, gaining its reward (see
next page) and flipping its Pillage token to its "pillaged"
side. Note that in this case you don't gain any Glory for
winning battles.
Otherwise, a battle will take place, and all figures in the
province being pillaged, or its supporting fjord, must
participate in it.
1. Call to Battle: Players may move adjacent figures
to join the battle.
2. Play Cards: Players in the battle reveal cards to
add STR and/or special effects.
3. Resolution: Highest STR determines the winner.
Losers are destroyed, winner gets rewards.
The Phases Of Play 17
2. PLAY CARDS
Each player participating in the battle must choose one
card from their hand and hold it face down in front of
them (unless they have no cards left in their hand; in that
case they don't have to put a card in). Then they all reveal
their chosen card simultaneously.
If you reveal a Battle card, its +STR bonus will be added to
the total STR of your figures in the battle. Also, any special
abilities listed on the card takes effect at this point.
If, however, you reveal an Upgrade or Quest card, it adds
nothing to your Strength in battle and has no effect.
Each clan adds together the STR of each of its involved figures,
and adds the +STR bonus offered by their played Battle
card (if any). This is their clan's total STR in that battle.
Note: If a card's special effect causes a player to lose all
the figures he had in the battle before comparing STR,
that does not mean that clan is out of the battle. The figures
were destroyed in the course of battle, and the clan
might still emerge victorious if its played Battle card has
enough STR.
3. RESOLUTION
The player with the highest STR total wins the battle! In
case of a tie, all participating players lose the battle.
The winner of the battle (if any) must discard all cards
he played. The losers of the battle take all of their played
cards back into their hands.
All losing players must destroy all of their figures that
were in the battle (including those that were supporting
from fjords), placing them on the Valhalla sheet.
If the player who initiated the Pillage wins the battle,
they have successfully pillaged the province and gain the
Pillage Reward indicated in the Pillage token (see below).
Flip the token to its "pillaged" side to indicate that the
province cannot be pillaged again until the next Age.
If the pillaging player does not win the battle, the province
is not pillaged and nobody gets the Pillage Reward.
Any player (including the pillager) can try again later in
the phase to pillage the province.
Finally, the winner of the battle gains Battle Glory,
whether he's the pillaging player or not. The number of
Glory points they get is equal to their current Axes stat,
as indicated on their clan sheet.
Some special Battle
cards can be used to
further increase the
Strength of your troops
even after players have
revealed their cards.
These special cards
have their STR bonus
on a solid white disc,
and they indicate in the
card text that they can
be played after cards
are revealed but before
determining a winner
(they can also be
played normally). The
pillaging player has the
first chance to add Strength from one of these special
cards, and it proceeds clockwise around the table
from there until nobody wants to play any.
PILLAGE REWARDS
When you successfully Pillage this
province, increase your clan's Rage
stat one step. You do not gain additional
Rage during this phase, but you
will start with more in the next Age.
When you successfully Pillage this
province, increase your clan's Axes
stat one step. The increased Glory for
victory in battle takes effect immediately
and includes this battle.
When you successfully Pillage this
province, increase your clan's Horns
stat one step.
When you successfully Pillage this
province, gain 5 Glory.
When you successfully Pillage Yggdrasil,
increase all three of your clan
stats one step.
The Phases Of Play
3. Both of blue's Warriors die and are sent to
Valhalla, but the blue player keeps his Upgrade
card and returns it to his hand. Red
pillages Andlang, flips the pillage token face
down on the board, and increases her clan stat
for Axes by one step, raising its value from
3 to 4. She then gains 4 Glory for her battle
victory and discards her played battle card.
Example:
1. The Wolf clan player (red) chooses to Pillage
Andlang. She can do this despite not having any
figures in Andlang, because her Ship is in the supporting
fjord. The Raven clan player (blue), seated to
her left, moves his Warrior from Gimle to an empty
village in Andlang. The Serpent clan player (yellow)
would love to join this battle by moving her Leader
from Horgr to Andlang, since Horgr has already been
pillaged, but Horgr is not adjacent, so she can't. The
red player moves a Warrior from Yggdrasil to one of
the empty villages in Andlang, then the blue player
moves a Warrior from Yggdrasil, taking the last
empty village in Andlang. The red player would really
like to move another Warrior in from Yggdrasil, but
there are no empty villages left in Andlang.
The red and blue players are the only ones with any
presence in Andlang, so they will be the only ones
fighting. Red has a total Strength of 3 (2 for the Ship
and 1 for the Warrior) while blue has a total Strength
of 2 (2 Warriors, each with 1 STR). They select their
cards, place them on the table, then reveal them.
2. Red reveals Tyr's Crush, a battle card with a
value of +4. But blue had no intention of winning,
and simply reveals an Upgrade card, adding
nothing to his Strength. Red ends up with a
Strength of 7 (3+4), and blue with 2 (2+0). Red
wins the battle.
The Phases Of Play 19
Discard Phase
Players can only keep a single card (if they have any left)
to carry over to the next Age. All players must discard
down to one card.
In the Third Age players should discard all cards, completely
emptying their hands.
Quest Phase
Each player reveals all Quests they have committed to.
If you have fulfilled a Quest's requirements, you gain
the amount of Glory indicated on the card, and may also
raise any one of your clan stats one step. If you fail to fulfill
a Quest, you get nothing, but you also lose nothing.
Discard all revealed Quests, whether successful or not.
Most Quests involve having
the most Strength in
any one of the provinces
of a particular region. Add
together the STR of each of
your figures in that province
(including the supporting
fjord) and compare
your total to the total STR
of each other clan in that
same province. If your total
is greater, you fulfill the
Quest. If you tie with an enemy,
you fail the Quest.
Example: The Serpent player
(yellow) reveals she has
committed to the Manheim!
Quest. She'll succeed if she has
the most STR in any province
of the Manheim region. In
Elvagar the red player has
three STR 1 Warriors, for a total
of STR 3, while the yellow
player also has a total of STR 3
due to her STR 1 Warrior and
STR 2 Ship in the supporting
fjord. Since it's a tie, Elvagar
does not grant the Serpent
player the Quest.
However, her STR 2 Ship is also
supporting Angerboda, where
the blue player has only a STR
1 Warrior. With this the Quest
succeeds and the Serpent clan
gets the 5 Glory listed on the
Quest cards and the player decides
to raise her Horns stat
one step.
20 The Phases Of Play
The Phases Of Play 21
Ragnark Phase
Take the token that's on the current Ragnark slot and
place it on its corresponding province, with the "destroyed"
side facing up. That province is destroyed forever
and is out of the game.
There can be no more glorious death to a Viking than to
be destroyed in Ragnark. When a province is destroyed
this way, all figures in that province, and in its supporting
fjord, die and are placed in Valhalla. Each such figure
earns its clan some Glory. The amount of Glory granted
is indicated on each Ragnark slot on the Age Track. For
each of their figures (including Monsters) destroyed in
Ragnark, the players gain 2 Glory in the First Age, 3 Glory
in the Second Age, and 4 Glory in the Third Age.
Next, place the Doom token on the province indicated by
the next Age's Ragnark token.
Release Valhalla Phase
At the end of each Age, all figures in Valhalla are returned
to their respective owners. Move all figures on
the Valhalla sheet belonging to your clan back to your
reserve. Any figures on the game board remain there.
End of an Age
Before moving on to the next Age, flip
all Pillage tokens on the board back to
their "reward" side. These tokens are
not reshuffled; they stay on the same
province throughout the game.
The First Player token is passed to the
player to the left.
Then, move the Saga token down to
the first phase of the next Age on the
Age Track. A new Age will then begin
with a new set of Gods' Gifts. With
each new Age, those gifts will grow in
strength and power, offering greater
glory, and leading to greater clashes on
the board over less and less remaining
territory as Ragnark continues to destroy
the land.
Example: The Ragnark token indicates Gimle, so it's taken
from the Age Track, flipped and placed on the Gimle province
on the board, destroying it. All figures in that province and
supporting fjord are destroyed and placed in Valhalla. Two red
figures and two blue figures are destroyed. Since the Age Track
indicated a 3 Glory reward this Ragnark phase, each player
gains 6 Glory. The Doom token is then moved to the province
indicated in the next Ragnark phase: Andlang.
22 The Phases Of Play
Once the Release Valhalla phase of the Third Age is completed,
the world has come to an end, and so has the game.
It is now time to see what clan has gained the most glory
and earned its place in Valhalla next to Odin's throne!
There is one last bonus to tally, though. Players gain a
Glory bonus for increasing each of their clan's stats to
legendary levels. At the end of the game only, for each of
your clan stats that has been increased to the 4th or 5th
step, gain +10 Glory. For each of your clan stats that has
been increased to the last step, gain +20 Glory.
Example: The Raven player has managed to raise two of his
clan stats to legendary levels. At the end of the game he gains
+10 Glory for Rage and +20 Glory for Axes, for a total of +30
Glory.
The player whose clan has the most Glory is then declared
the winner!

PLAY TIPS:
Blood Rage is not just a simple area control game.
While winning battles can certainly be a path to victory,
you can sometimes gain a great deal by dying.
In a suicidal battle, you can gain glory as your troops
are sent to Valhalla. And at the same time you deplete
cards from the hand of the winner, weakening
them for future battles.
Quests can score huge amounts of glory. They're much
too powerful to ignore. But if you collect too many
of them, you may be too weak to accomplish them.
You need to strike a balance. It's also important to
watch the other players as they invade and pillage. If
you can figure out which quests they are committed
to, you have a much better chance of stopping them
from completing those quests.

What If There Isn't a Rule for That?
Many hours went into playtesting this game, but it's still possible you'll
run into situations where the game rules or haunt books don't clearly
answer a question about game play. Don't let that slow you down. In such
cases, come to an agreement as a group for what makes the most sense
and go with it. (If that doesn't work, fl ip a coin to decide.) Then continue
your experience in the house.

GAME OVERVIEW:
In Betrayal at House on the Hill, each player chooses a character to explore a creepy old
house. As you explore the house, you discover new rooms. Each time you enter a new room,
you might fi nd something . . . or something might fi nd you. Explorers get better (or worse)
depending on how they deal with the house's surprises. The house is different each time
you build it.
At some random point during the game, one explorer triggers a scenario called a haunt.
When the haunt is revealed, one explorer betrays everyone else. That explorer becomes
a traitor bent on defeating his former companions. The rest of the explorers become
heroes struggling to survive. From then on, the game is a fight between the traitor and
the heroes . . . often a fight to the death.
This game has 50 haunts, and each one tells a different story. Each one of them is yours
to explore as you live or die in the House on the Hill.

GAME COMPONENTS:
- 1 rulebook
- 2 haunt books (Traitor's Tome and Secrets of Survival)
- 44 room tiles
- 1 Entrance Hall tile (3 rooms)
- 6 plastic character figures
- 6 two-sided character cards
- 30 plastic clips
- 8 dice
- 1 Turn/Damage Track
- 13 omen cards
- 22 item cards
- 45 event cards
- 291 tokens, including:
- 12 large circular monster tokens (includes art)
- 204 circular monster tokens
- 14 square event and room tokens
- 43 pentagonal item tokens
- 18 triangular trait roll tokens

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
Explore the house and make your character stronger until
the "haunt" scenario begins. After that, your goal is to
complete your side's victory condition fi rst, either as a traitor
or a hero.

SETUP:
 Set aside the Traitor's Tome and Secrets of
Survival haunt books. You'll use them after the
haunt is revealed.
 Each player chooses a character card. There's a
different explorer on each side of a character card.
Pick one.
 Attach 4 plastic clips to your explorer card. Each
one should point to one of the explorer's GREEN
starting numbers for his or her Speed, Might,
Knowledge, and Sanity.
 Shuffle a stack of omen cards and put it facedown
where everyone can reach it. Do the same with the
item cards and the event cards.
 Find the Basement Landing, Entrance Hall/Foyer/
Grand Staircase, and Upper Landing room tiles.
Place them from left to right reasonably far apart.
 Mix all of the rest of the room tiles together and
put them facedown in a stack. (Don't worry about
which floor is shown on the back of the tiles.)
 Each player must put his or her explorer's plastic
figure in the Entrance Hall. (Each explorer's figure
matches the color behind an explorer's picture on his
or her character card.)
 Put the dice in a pile within easy reach. You'll need
them throughout the game.
 See who goes first. The explorer who has the next
birthday goes first. (Look on your explorer's character
card to see his or her birthday.) Players take turns
clockwise following the first explorer.


HOW TO PLAY:
Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player takes a turn exploring
the house.

ON YOUR TURN:
 you can do as many of the following actions as you want, in any order:
 You can move.
 You can discover a new room.
 You can attempt a die roll.
 You can use items or omen cards.
 You can attack (once during your turn after the haunt starts).
Before the haunt starts, you must make a haunt roll at the end of your turn if you draw an
omen card (see "Making a Haunt Roll"). The game has a few new twists after the haunt
starts (as described in "The Haunt").

MOVING:
On your explorer's turn, you can move up to number of spaces equal to your character's
current Speed. Whenever a game effect makes you draw a card, you must STOP moving for
the rest of your turn.

DISCOVERING A NEW ROOM:
When your explorer enters a doorway, and there isn't a room on the other side, look at the
top tile on the room stack. If it has the name of the floor you are on (ground floor, basement,
or upper floor), turn it over and connect it to the doorway you just entered. Then move
into that room. Add each new tile as logically as you can, creating adjacent rooms with
connecting doors. (Connect doorways whenever possible.)
If the top tile can't go on the floor you're currently on, set
it aside facedown in a discard pile. Keep setting tiles aside
until you fi nd one that works on your floor. (Some tiles work
on more than one floor.)
An explorer can move through a door if it connects to
another door in an adjacent room. Doors are always open.
The one exception is the front door. It's always locked. You
can't leave the house or use the front door unless a haunt
says otherwise. (Outside rooms like the Patio are still part of
the house.)
Staircases connect floors. The Grand Staircase always connects to the Upper Landing. The
Stairs from Basement always lead to and from the Foyer through a secret door. (You can't
use the Stairs from Basement until you discover that room in the basement.)
Some rooms also have rules on them, which apply to your explorer each time you enter the
room. Some rooms affect movement. A few rooms are clarified in the "Special Rooms" sidebar.
What happens if we get to the end
of the stack of room tiles?
If you go through the whole stack
of room tiles, shuffle the tiles you
set aside in a discard pile, and then
continue with the new stack. If you
run out of room tiles for one of the
floors of the house (the basement,
ground floor, or upper level), you
can't discover any more rooms on
that floor  you've found them all.
In this example, if your explorer has a Speed of 3,
you can move from the Entrance Hall to the Foyer,
then from the Foyer to the Kitchen, and then to the
Dining Room. If you're feeling more adventurous, you
could go through one of the empty doorways in the
Entrance Hall or Foyer and discover a new room. If
the new room you fi nd doesn't require you to draw a
card, you can keep going . . . but if it does, you have
to stop.

DRAWING OMEN, ITEM, AND EVENT CARDS:
A room may have a card symbol on it. The
first time you discover a room with a card symbol, you must
end your move in that room and draw the appropriate card.
If the room has a spiral symbol , draw an event
card. Read it out loud. Follow its instructions, which
may require you to attempt rolls. Then discard the card
unless it says otherwise or has an ongoing effect.
If the room has a bull's head symbol , draw an item
card. Read it out loud. Place it face up in front of you;
you now have it in your possession. You may use it once
immediately and once on each of your turns, unless it
says otherwise.
If the room has a raven symbol , draw an omen
card. Read it out loud. Place it face up in front of you;
you now have it in your possession. You might have to
do something immediately. At the end of your turn, you
must make a haunt roll. (See "Making a Haunt Roll.")

traits here.>>

USING ITEM AND OMEN CARDS:
You can use an item once at any point during your turn. Most
omen cards (except the Bite card) are also items you keep,
and they're used like other items.
Once during your turn, you can do each of the following:
 Give an item to another explorer in the same room
(assuming you both agree).
 Drop any number of items. (If you do, put an Item
Pile token in that room.) Another explorer (or you, for
that matter) can later pick up some or all of the items
in the pile, removing the token if all of the items are
picked up.
 Pick up one or more items from a pile of items.
Some items, like the Armor, can't be traded, but they can be
dropped or picked up.
Some omens, like the Dog, aren't items at all, so they can't
be dropped or traded. They're companions that follow
the explorer who has custody of them. (The Dog, Girl, and
Madman all work this way.)

SPECIAL ROOMS:
Many room tiles have rules printed on them, but some of them
also have special rules, listed here.
The Entrance Hall: The Entrance Hall, Foyer, and Grand
Staircase are all on the same room tile, but they count as three
separate rooms.

THE MYSTIC ELEVATOR:
This tile moves as soon as you enter it. Roll 2 dice and put it
adjacent to a connecting door on the appropriate floor. (If there
isn't one, leave the Mystic Elevator where it is.) If you roll the
same floor, you can move the elevator to a different connecting
door on your floor. You can use the elevator only once a turn.

THE COAL CHUTE:
Entering the Coal Chute and moving to the Basement Landing
counts as one space of movement. A turn can't end with an
explorer or monster on the Coal Chute space. (That figure will
always slide down to the Basement Landing.)

THE VAULT:
Once the Vault has been opened, put the Vault Empty token
on it.

THE COLLAPSED ROOM:
Only the explorer who first discovers the Collapsed Room needs
to make the Speed roll listed there. Thereafter, any explorer
entering the room can either ignore the room ability or use it
intentionally, in which case that explorer still takes the damage.
Falling to the basement doesn't count as moving a space.
Only the fi rst explorer to fall to the basement from the Collaped
Room draws and places a basement tile. Put the Below
Collapsed Room token on the room where the first person
landed.

THE CRYPT:
Monsters ignore this room's special rules.

THE FURNACE ROOM:
Monsters ignore this room's special rules.

THE CHASM, CATACOMBS, VAULT, AND TOWER:
These are all barrier rooms. A barrier can stop you from moving
to the other side of the room. Crossing a barrier requires a
trait roll listed on the room tile (either Might, Speed, Sanity, or
Knowledge). You can attempt this roll once during your turn.
Crossing the barrier doesn't count as moving a space. If you fail
the roll, you can't cross the barrier, though you can still move
back the way you came. Monsters always ignore barriers.
What happens if the
rules in the book and the
rules on a card conflict?
If this happens, use the
rules on the card.

ATTEMPTING A DIE ROLL:
Many times during the game,
you'll need to roll dice. For
instance, you might need to
roll dice for a card you've
drawn or when your explorer
moves onto a room tile.
If a card tells you to roll a
specific number of dice, do
so and add the number of
dots on each die to get the
result of the die roll. Then
do what the card says for
that result.
Sometimes a card or room
tile tells you to attempt
a roll based on one of
your explorer's traits
(Speed, Might, Sanity, or
Knowledge). When that
happens, roll as many dice
as your explorer currently
has in that trait. For
example, if your explorer
must attempt a Sanity roll,
and she currently has a
Sanity of 4, roll 4 dice and
add the dots together to
get the result. Whether you
succeed or fail, the card or
tile will tell you the results
of your attempt.

MAKING AN ATTACK:
Once during your turn, you can attack an opponent in the same room. You can't attack
anyone until after the haunt starts.
When you make an attack, roll a number of dice equal to your Might. Your opponent does
the same. Whoever rolls a higher result inflicts physical damage to the other explorer
or monster. That player defeats his or her opponent. The amount of damage equals the
difference between the two rolls. (For example, if you roll a 6 and your opponent gets a 5,
you would inflict 1 point of physical damage.) If there's a tie, no one gets hurt.
When you take physical damage, you lower your explorer's Might and/or Speed traits a total
number of spaces equal to the amount of damage you took.
Once the haunt begins, if any of your traits (Speed, Might, Sanity, or Knowledge) moves
down to the skull symbol , your explorer dies. Before the haunt starts, no one can diethat
is, no trait can go below the lowest number on the list (it stays at the lowest value instead).
Sometimes a card or a haunt lets you make an attack with a trait other than Might. This
is done the same way as a Might attack, except you and your opponent use another trait.
For example, if you make a Speed attack, you and your opponent roll dice based on Speed.
Speed attacks inflict physical damage like Might attacks.
When a card or a haunt lets you attack with Sanity or Knowledge, then you infl ict mental
damage. You and your opponent move down your Sanity and/or Knowledge traits.
You can't use a trait to attack an opponent who doesn't have that trait. For instance, if a
monster doesn't have Sanity, you can't make a Sanity attack against it.
Sometimes when you attack, you do something other than damage your opponent. For
instance, you may be able to steal an item (see "Special Attacks").
Monsters are only stunned when you defeat them, unless a haunt specifies otherwise.

THE HAUNT:
Making a Haunt Roll
Before the haunt starts, you must roll 6 dice at the end of
your turn each time you draw an omen card. This is called a
haunt roll. If you roll less than the total number of omen
cards all players have drawn this game, the haunt starts.
The player who starts the haunt with this roll is called the
haunt revealer.
For example, if you draw an omen card on your turn, and the
players have already drawn a total of 4 omen cards during
the game, you need a result of 4 or less on your haunt roll to
start the haunt.
Special Attacks
Distance attacks: The Revolver allows you to attack
someone in a room within your line of sight path that
leads through an uninterrupted straight line of doors. You
take no damage if the subject of your distance attack defeats
you. Some monsters can also make distance attacks.
Stealing items: If you attack someone and inflict 2 or
more points of physical damage, you can steal a tradable
item instead of doing the damage. You can't do this with a
distance attack.
Example of Taking Damage
Let's say your explorer,
Jenny LeClerc, just attacked
a Werewolf. She has a Might
of 4, so you roll 4 dice for
her attack. You get a 5 on
your attack roll. Then traitor
rolls an 8 for the Werewolf!
Jenny then has to take 3
points of physical damage.
You choose to lower her
Might 2 spaces and her
Speed down 1 space (by
sliding the plastic clips to
the new numbers). Jenny's
still alive, but she's hurt!

HAUNT SETUP:
Do the following at the start of the haunt:
 The traitor takes the Traitor's Tome and leaves the
room. The traitor reads only the haunt that is
starting now.
 The rest of the players become heroes. They look
up the haunt with the same number in Secrets of
Survival and read it together. (The heroes should also
talk briefly about their plan for survival.)
 When everyone is ready (including the traitor), the
traitor returns to the room. Both sides (the heroes and
the traitor) do anything the haunt told them to do
in the Right Now section. (For example, sometimes
you'll have to put tokens in the house or draw cards.)
Haunt Turn Order
The first turn always starts with the player to the traitor's
left and goes clockwise (further away from the traitor). Each
of the heroes gets a hero turn. After each hero has had a
turn, the traitor gets his or her traitor turn. After the traitor's
turn, any monsters controlled by the traitor get a monster
turn. (One player gets two turns: one for the traitor and one
for the monsters.) Then the first hero to the left of the traitor
goes, and so on.
The heroes and traitor are all still explorers. They can do
the same things they did before the haunt was revealed,
except they don't have to attempt further haunt rolls (even
if one of them gets an omen card). The traitor has to tell the
heroes what he or she is doing each turn, but not why; the
same condition applies to the heroes.
After the haunt begins, explorers can die. If one of your
explorer's 4 traits moves down to a skull , then that
explorer dies. Sometimes during a haunt, a hero will actually
become a traitor when he or she "dies."
Sometimes the traitor is transformed or otherwise disposed
of at the start of the haunt, but the traitor still gets a turn
after all the heroes do. Even if the traitor dies, as long as the
monsters can complete the haunt's goals, the monsters still
get their turn (and the traitor controls them).

Optional Rule: Selecting
the Haunt
If you consult the chart
and get a haunt you've
used already, and you
don't want to do it again,
look for the next room
with an omen symbol
closest to the revealer
of the haunt. Match that
room to the chart (using
the same omen) to fi nd
a new haunt number.
Continue going from room
to room this way until
you fi nd a haunt that you
haven't revealed. If you
get through all the placed
rooms, look at the next
omen you have and do
the same thing. With this
optional rule, you can play
through all of the haunts
without repeating ones
you've already played.
Revealing the Haunt
When a player makes a haunt roll and starts the haunt, that
player looks on the inside front cover of Secrets of Survival
or the Traitor's Tome. A haunt chart on that page shows
which haunt has been revealed...and who is the traitor.
The chart on the inside cover has a list of omen cards (across
the top of the chart) and a list of rooms (along the side of the
chart). Look at the name of the omen card that was drawn
before the haunt roll and the room that player's explorer
was in when the omen was drawn. Find the corresponding
haunt number. This is the haunt you're going to play.
When you fi nd out who the traitor is, give the Traitor's
Tome to that player. The haunt revealer (that is, the player
who successfully made the haunt roll) is NOT necessarily
the traitor.
Special Cases: If two or more people could be the traitor,
and one of them is the haunt revealer, then that person is
the traitor. If neither one was the haunt revealer, then the
closest player on the haunter revealer's left is the traitor.
For example, if the haunt revealer had the Girl omen card, and her explorer was in the
Catacombs, you would be playing Haunt #1, "The Mummy Walks."

HEROES AND SECRETS:
Don't tell the traitor what your goals are, unless you're sure the traitor already knows them
or you're doing something as part of the haunt. Sometimes you have an advantage over the
traitor because that player doesn't know what you're trying to do. You can still play these
haunts again and again after you know how they work, but until then, the heroes shouldn't
disclose the Secrets of Survival for their haunt.

THE TRAITOR'S NEW POWERS:
When your explorer becomes a traitor, you can use the
following abilities (unless a haunt says otherwise):
 You can use or ignore any non-damaging room effects
or cards you draw. You can walk across the Chasm,
decide where the Mystic Elevator goes, leave the
Junk Room without rolling, and so on.
 You can choose not to be affected by an event card. If
you choose to be affected by one, though, you have to
accept any rolls or penalties.
 After you finish your turn, you move and attack with
all of the monsters, if any. Even if the traitor dies,
you still control the monsters. In some haunts, the
monsters are still able to complete a haunt's goals
after the traitor is dead.
What happens to my stuff
if I die?
If you die and you have a
companion (the Dog, the
Girl, or the Madman), its
token stays in the room
where you died. Set aside
that omen card. If another
explorer enters the room, he
or she gains custody of that
companion (and takes that
omen card). When you die,
any other items you have
drop to the fl oor. Put an Item
Pile token there and set
aside those item or omen
cards. Other players can
go to the room to pick up
your items (and take those
cards).
Moving Past Opponents
For each opponent in a
room with you after the
haunt starts, an explorer
must use one extra space
of movement to leave
that room. An opponent
is an explorer or monster
that wants to stop your
movement. No matter how
many penalties you have on
a turn, you can always move
at least one space.
Stunned monsters don't slow
an explorer's movement in
this way.
What happens if a haunt's
rules and the regular rules
conflict?
If this happens, use the rules
in the haunt. All of these
rules are in effect unless a
haunt says otherwise.

HOW MONSTERS WORK:
Monsters behave a little differently than explorers do. All
of the following rules are in effect unless a haunt says
otherwise.
 Monsters move differently. At the start of the
monster turn, roll a number of dice equal to each
monster's Speed. That's the number of spaces that
monster can move that turn. For groups of the same
type of monster (Bats or Zombies, for instance), just
roll once for the whole group. Each monster of that
type can then move that many spaces that turn.
 Most monsters can't be killed. If a monster suffers
any damage, it is stunned and misses its next turn.
When a monster is stunned, flip its token over. At the
end of the monster's next turn, flip it back. Stunned
monsters can't slow an explorer's movement.
 Like explorers, a monster can attack only once
during its turn. Monsters often use traits other
than Might to attack. They can't make any of the
Special Attacks on page 9 (again, unless a haunt says
otherwise).
 Like traitors, monsters can ignore all nondamaging
room features. They can use the Coal
Chute, Collapsed Room, Gallery, Mystic Elevator,
and stairs tiles, along with many of the special
movement options described on cards (such as
the Secret Stairs), unless those cards say that only
explorers can use them. They ignore the effect of the
Furnace Room and the Crypt.
 Monsters can't explore new rooms.
 Monsters can't carry items (unless the haunt says
otherwise). If a monster that is allowed to carry items
is stunned, it drops all items and puts an Item Pile
token in the room. The monster can't pick up the
items until it has an active turn.

WINNING THE GAME:
The first side (traitor or heroes) that completes its goals
for the haunt wins the game.
At least one hero must survive in order for the heroes to win.
However, some haunts include goals that are written so that
the traitor can still win the game after he or she dies. For
instance, the monsters that player controls may be able to
win the game without the traitor's help.
The game ends when one side completes its goals (listed
in the "You Win When" section of the haunt). When this
happens, someone from the winning side reads the "If You
Win" section from that side's haunt book out loud.




GAME NAME:
King of New York

HOW TO PLAY:
Players take turns in clockwise
order.
In order to see who goes first,
each player rolls the 6 black
dice and the 2 green dice,
and whoever rolls the most
Attacks
Faces for dices (King of Tokyo) (2 kinds of dice, black dice and green dice)
starts the game.
Starting with the first player, and
going clockwise: Place your Monster
in the borough of your choice,
except Manhattan. There can be
no more than 2 Monsters in any
borough.
Note: From here on out, the
rules and cards will refer to the
players as Monsters.
On Your Turn:
1. Roll the Dice (up to 3 times)
2. Resolve the Dice (mandatory)
3. Move (generally optional, but
sometimes mandatory)
4. Buy Cards (optional)
5. End Your Turn

1. ROLL THE DICE:
On your turn, you can roll the dice
up to three times.
For your first roll, you will roll the 6
black dice (the green dice are only
used with particular cards).
For your second and third rolls (both
optional), you can reroll any or all of
the dice (even ones that you chose
to keep on a previous roll).

2. RESOLVE THE DICE:
The symbols on the dice after your
final roll indicate your actions for
this turn.
You can resolve the dice in whatever
order you like, however all
the dice of the same type must
be resolved before resolving another
type.

3. MOVE:
 If there is no one in Manhattan
you must move there. When you
arrive in Manhattan, you must
place your Monster on Lower
Manhattan on the 24 space.
 If there is already 1 Monster
in any zone of Manhattan, you
have two options: You can move
to any borough that doesn't
already have 2 Monsters in it
(except Manhattan), or you can
just stay in your borough.
 If you were already in Manhattan,
advance to the 24
space in the next zone up in
Manhattan.
Note: Once you are in Upper
Manhattan, you no longer
move during this phase.
Note: If you were already in
Manhattan, you may not move
to another borough (unless you
have been damaged by another
Monster's attack).

4. BUY CARDS:
After resolving the dice and
making a move, you can buy one
or more cards from those available.
You are also welcome to spend
2 Energy cubes (2 ) in order to
discard the three available cards
and reveal three new ones.
You can buy and/or discard cards
in any order you like, and as many
times as you want, as long as you
have the Energy cubes to do so.
Each time you buy a card,
immediately reveal a
replacement for it from the
deck.
 Example: Kong has 10
and doesn't like the cards currently
available. He spends 2 to
discard the three cards and reveal
the next three. He still has 8
and sees an interesting card that
costs 3 . He buys it and reveals a
new card. He still has 5 which he
decides to keep for another turn.

5. END YOUR TURN:
Certain card effects activate
during this phase.
This is the end of your turn; pass
the dice to the player on your left.

Description of the dice:
Each die has 6 symbols.
: Energy : Heal
: Attack : Celebrity
: Destruction : Ouch!

- If you are in Manhattan each
Faces for dices (King of tokyo) (2 kinds of dice, black dice and green dice)
you roll infl icts damage to all
Monsters outside Manhattan.
- If you are not in Manhattan
each
Faces for dices (King of tokyo) (2 kinds of dice, black dice and green dice)
you roll infl icts damage
to all Monsters in Manhattan.
Each
Faces for dices (King of tokyo) (2 kinds of dice, black dice and green dice)
causes any Monster(s)
damaged to lose 1 Life Point
(1 ).
If a Monster loses its last Life
Point ( ), it is eliminated.
If there are no Monsters in
Manhattan at the start of your
turn, you don't infl ict any
damage, even if you roll
Faces for dices (King of tokyo) (2 kinds of dice, black dice and green dice)
Faces for dices (King of tokyo) (2 kinds of dice, black dice and green dice)
you rolled
allows you to heal 1 Life
Point ( ) that you've lost, unless
you are in Manhattan.
A Monster cannot have more than
10 .

DESTRUCTION:
You can use to
destroy Buildings or
eliminate Units.
The Durability of a Building or
Unit indicates the number of
you have to roll in order to destroy
it on your turn.
When you apply as many Destruction
points as the Unit or
Building's durability, it is destroyed,
and you earn as many
(for High-Rises or Tanks), (for
Power Plants or Jets), or (for
Hospitals or Infantries) as indicated
on the tile.
When you destroy a Building,
turn it over to its Unit side, and
place it in the same borough.
If there are still Buildings in
the stack, this will reveal a new
one, and you can even destroy it
immediately if you have enough
remaining.
When you destroy a Unit, take it
and put it in front of you.
You cannot destroy a Unit on the
same turn that it appears.
If you have enough to destroy
a Building or a Unit, you must
to do so; however you are not
required to optimize your .
 Example: Captain Fish rolls
, he is in Queens, where
there are 3 Buildings visible: a
Hospital 2, a High-Rise 2, and a
High-Rise 1. He decides to destroy
the High-Rise 1 and High-Rise 2
to earn 3 . He still has 1 , but
the Buildings revealed are a Hospital
3 and a High-Rise 2. He can't
destroy any more Buildings with
the he has left.

CELEBRITY:
If you roll fewer than
3 nothing happens.
If you roll triple- or more, you
take the Superstar card, and place
it in front of you. You immediately
earn 1 +1 per beyond the
fi rst three .
From now on, as long as you have
the Superstar card in front of you,
each you roll earns you 1 .
As soon as another Monster rolls a
triple- , he steals the Superstar
Ouch!
If you roll at least 1 , the
military opens fi re:
- If you rolled , the Units in
your borough attack you; you suffer
1 damage per Unit tile in your
borough.
- If you rolled , the Units
in your borough attack all the
Monsters in your borough (including
you, of course); each Monster
in your borough suffers 1 damage
per Unit tile in your borough.
- If you rolled , all Units
in the entire city attack; each
Monster suffers 1 damage per Unit
tile in his borough.
Moreover, by rolling ,
you trigger a counterattack by the
entire army, and you become the
defender of the city: The Statue
of Liberty comes to life and teams
up with you. Take the Statue of
Liberty card and place it in front

 GAME NAME:
 GALAXY TRUCKER

The game consists of three rounds. In each
round, the players begin by rummaging through the
Warehouse, trying to grab the best components and
build the best space ship. Once the ships are under
way, the players try to avoid snares and obstacles,
while grasping financial opportunities, each hoping
to be the first to finish with an undamaged ship.
In Round 1, players build Class I ships and fly
them on a safe short hop. In Round 2, they
build larger Class II ships to take on a more
daring journey. In Round 3, they build
gigantic Class III ships and set out for the
farthest, most dangerous corners of the
Galaxy.
Longer journeys offer greater rewards,
but also present greater dangers.
For these contracts, Corp Inc.
only accepts experienced
applicants with a strong credit
rating (and a net worth ensuring that,
if need be, Corp Inc. can collect any
debts from the contractor's estate).
The goal of the game is to have the most cosmic
credits at the end of Round 3.

COURSE OF THE GAME:
Corporation Incorporated is an interplanetary construction firm that builds
sewer systems and low-income housing on the less-developed planets of the Galaxy.
For years, Corp Inc. has tottered on the brink of bankruptcy: transporting building materials
to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is greatest, is a risky business.
The company was saved by a few visionaries on the board of directors. Instead
of shipping materials to the Periphery, they reasoned, why not build the materials
into spacecraft and let them ship themselves? Furthermore, why hire pilots if there
are nut-cases who will do it for free?
That's where you come in. Just sign the contract, and you gain unrestricted access
to a Corp Inc. warehouse. Build your own space ship from the available prefabricated
components, and fly it to the Periphery. Of course, you may have to eat a loss,
but any profits you make along the way are yours to keep, and Corporation Incorporated
will pay you a bonus for quick delivery.
It's possible that you will end up with an insurmountable debt and finish your days
panhandling on the streets of Deneb III, but if Lady Luck should smile upon you, you just
might find yourself among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy!
Remember the words of Wild Andy, the famous
multimillionaire-adventurer: "The best way to learn
to fly a space craft is to fly one." Of course, Andy
uttered these words just before crashing his
rocketplane into Sirius, but we're willing to give
him the benefit of the doubt.

SETUP:
Each player takes a space ship
board labeled "I". Place your
starting component on the
square with this "I". It represents
your pilot cabin. There are four of
these, each in a different color.
For fewer than four players,
leave the extra ones in the box.
Turn the other components face down
and mix them up in a pile in the center
of the table where everyone can reach
them. This pile is the Warehouse.
Near this pile, place the tiles numbered
"1" through "4" ("1" through "3" for
three players or "1" and "2" for two
players) in a row.
For now, you can leave the other game
pieces in the box.

GRABBING COMPONENTS:
When everyone is ready, the boldest player says, "Go!"
Everyone grabs a (face-down) component from the pile in the
middle of the table. You can only take one at a time. Place it on
your space ship board and turn it face up.
Now you have two possibilities: either add it to your space ship
or return it face up to the center of the table. Thus, face-up
components will appear on the table. Players can take these
or grab a face-down component, hoping for something better.
Players do not take turns. You play as fast as you can grab,
with the following rules:
You can only grab with one hand. The other hand has to
stay above your space ship board.
You can't turn up a face-down component and look at it on
the table. You have to keep it face down until it is above
your space ship board.
Until you add the component to your space ship or return it
to the center of the table, you cannot grab another one.
You can't move a component once it has been added to your
space ship, but you can move your newest component around
while deciding whether to add it and where. Until you grab
another component, you can change your mind about where
to put your newest component or whether to keep it at all.

BUILDING SHIPS:
You start with one starting component and add new ones as
you go. Each new component must be placed on an empty
square next to one already placed. Components can only be
placed on the indicated squares.
Each component has a functional part and 1 to 4 connectors.
Connectors can be simple, double, or universal.
Any connector can join with another of the same type,
and a universal connector can join with any type. A simple
connector cannot join with a double connector. Sides with
no connectors are called smooth sides. Smooth sides cannot
join with any connectors.
Each component you place must join with the rest of your space
ship. If it touches the ship on multiple sides, all connectors
must legally join. Two smooth sides may sit next to each other
as long as the piece being added makes a legal connection on
another side. Your ship must hold together at all times.

YOUR FIRST SHIP:
You can play Round 1 without reading all the rules beforehand. Read the section on building
ships  and build one. Read the section on preparing for launch  and prepare for it. Read the
section on test flights  and take the test flight. Only then do you need to read the rest of the
rules so you can play Rounds 2 and 3.

COMPONENTS:
The starting component represents your pilot cabin. It has
4 universal connectors, making it easy to build on to. The
Warehouse is full of other components you will want on your
space ship.
Cabins
You can add additional cabins to your ship,
allowing you to have a bigger crew. Bigger
crews are better so you want to have as
many cabins as possible.
Engines
Engines have special limitations: the exhaust
pipe must point to the rear of the space ship
(toward the player) and no component can
sit on the square behind the engine. This
means that the exhaust pipe either opens
into anempty square or the edge of the
building zone.
Ships with more engines are faster, so you want as many
engines as possible.
Cannons
Cannons can point in any direction, but
they are most effective when they point
forward (away from the player).
No component can sit on the square in
front of the cannon's barrel.
Many dangers await you on your journey. You may be in
combat, or you may need to blow up meteors. That's why
you want as many cannons as possible, especially forwardpointing
ones.
Double Engines and Cannons
The space ship's exterior limits the number
of engines and cannons that can be added,
high-powered components have been
developed to increase speed and fire power
beyond conventional maximums.
Engineers have tinkered with increasing surface area
to provide more mounting points. However, most
research in this direction has ceased since the Star
Ship Mbius exploded and imploded at the same time.
Double engines and cannons follow the same placement rules
as simple ones do. They have twice the power, but at the
expense of consuming a lot more energy. These components
cannot be used without batteries.
Batteries
Energy for double engines and double cannons
is stored in size E batteries. (The "E" is for
"E-normous.")
A battery component will have 2 or 3 E-cells.
Each E-cell stores enough energy to power one
use of a double engine, a double cannon, or a
shield (see below). Batteries can be anywhere
on the ship; they do not have to be next to the
component they are powering.
With matter-annihilation technology, it was possible
to store this much energy in a battery no larger than
a good cigar. Today, of course, matter annihilation
is illegal thanks to the lobbying efforts of matter
rights activists. (And narrowly defeated in the
last legislative session was a bill backed by the
gentlemen's clubs lobby to ban the use of good cigars
in silly comparisons.)
To get the most from your ship, you'll need double cannons and
double engines, which means you will want as many batteries
as possible.
Shield Generators
Shields are there for when things go wrong.
They can deflect smaller meteors and
typical hits from enemy cannons. They get
their power from batteries.
One shield generator can protect the ship
on two sides: the ones that are glowing green in the picture.
It works from any place on the ship. All that matters is which
way it is oriented.
Now you are probably expecting us to say you want as
many as possible. Of course not. You only need two shield
generators, provided they
are oriented to cover all four
directions. In fact, if you are
gutsy (or suicidal) you can fly
without any shields at all.
One shield covers the left
side and the front of the ship.
The other covers the left side
and the rear. The right side is
unprotected.
Cargo Holds
Cargo holds come with 2 or 3 containers. You
can put them anywhere. They can be used to
store the goods that you find along the way. Of
course, goods translate into profits, which is
what this journey is all about, so you want as
many cargo holds as possible.
Special Cargo Holds
Hazardous materials can only be transported in
reinforced containers, which are found in
special cargo holds. (These holds only have 1 or
2 containers.) Normal goods can be transported
in special holds or normal holds, but hazardous
goods can only be transported in special holds.
Of course there are thousands of horror stories
illustrating why hazardous goods should not be
transported in normal containers. We give only the
example of James "Skip" Fairweather, who decided
to transport several tons of plutonium in used fruit
crates. Upon landing, he lost both arms and one leg
to a mob of angry environmentalists.
Hazardous goods are the most valuable, so it is important to
have a lot of special cargo holds.
Structural Modules
Structural modules don't seem very important
because they don't do anything. However, they
have a lot of connectors, many of them
universal. Structural modules can make your
ship more durable so that it doesn't fly apart
the first time it gets hit by something.
Odd Bits with Unknown Purpose
Don't worry about these
other components right
now. On your first flight,
you can treat them just like
structural modules.

THE WELL-BUILT SHIP:
Above all, your ship must be built according to the rules. In
addition, it should be solid, bristling with cannons and engines,
full of cabins, batteries, and holds, and completely protected by
shields.
Exposed Connectors
Connectors that are not connected, i.e., those not adjacent
to another component, are considered to be exposed.
This ship has 8 exposed connectors
Exposed connectors are allowed, but they increase the risk
of damage to your ship and in some cases they can slow it
down. The ends of exposed pipes get warped in transit, so
Corporation Incorporated pays a bonus for ships that arrive
with few exposed connectors.

FINISHING YOUR SHIP:
Once you are happy with your ship (or once you run out of good
places to add on more components) you can finish your ship.
You do not have to place a component on every square of your
ship board.
To finish your ship, simply take the number
tile with the lowest remaining number. If
everyone else finishes before you, you will be
left with the highest-numbered tile, but you
will have as much time to finish your ship as you want. (In the
full game, there is a time limit, but for your first game, we
assume that anyone taking an unreasonably long time can be
persuaded to finish by gently thumping the box lid against his
head.)
The tiles determine the order in which the space ships will
launch. It is not enough to build a perfect space ship with lots
of everything and no exposed connectors. You want to be
the first.
But, before taking that tile, double-check to be sure your ship
is built according to the rules. In your first game, we can be
lenient. If you see a mistake, just remove a component so that
it no longer violates the rule, and play on.
Typical mistakes include:
A simple connector adjacent to a double.
Any type of connector adjacent to a smooth edge.
An engine not pointing toward the rear.
A component placed immediately behind an engine.
A component placed immediately in front of a cannon's
barrel.
A component outside the indicated building area.
A component or part of the ship not attached to the rest.
SPOT CHECK
Check everyone else's ship to be sure they are all built according
to the rules. Anyone found to have violated a ship building rule
must return his or her number tile and fix the mistake. Redistribute
the number tiles among those with legal ships so
that the highest numbers are left for those who are re-building

BANK:
Now you can take the sack and dump out all the figures,
blocks, markers, and dice. This is the bank. You want to keep
these things accessible but out of the way.

THE FLIGHT BOARD:
Remove all the remaining
components from the center
of the table and lay down the
flight board. In the center of
the flight board is a price list
and a graphical summary of
the rules for Round 1.
Around these information
boxes is a circle of triangular shapes. These are the spaces of
the game board which will indicate the relative position of your
ships. Each space represents one day of flight.
Take the two space ship markers in your color. Set one in
front of you and put the other one on the flight board. The
rules summary depicts the initial separation between your
space ships: The player with tile number 1 puts his or her
ship on the indicated starting space and the player with tile
number 2 puts his or her ship 2 spaces behind it. (That is,
with one empty space between, as shown in the diagram on
the game board.) The other players go behind the first two
with the same amount of separation. You can set the number
tiles aside now. Your figures on the flight board represent
your order of flight, which can change during the course of
the game. The player in front will be referred to as the leader.

PREPARING YOUR SHIP:
In each cabin, place 2 grey
figures. These are humans in
grey space suits. (The ones in
the other colors are aliens, but
you don't have to worry about
them right now.)
On each battery component,
place 2 or 3 green tokens
(depending on how many E-cells
are depicted).

ADVENTURE CARDS:
The adventure cards represent various
dangers and opportunities that you may
encounter on your journey.
From the deck labeled "I", take the eight
cards marked with an asterisk in the
lower left corner. Shuffle these eight
cards and set them near the flight board.

COSMIC CREDITS:
And now the best part: take the cosmic credits
and place them in neat stacks near the bank. On
your journey, you can look at them from time to
time and anticipate just how much money you
are going to make.
Far more important than money, of course, is the thrill
of adventure. And fame. And glory. And honor... Oh
who are we kidding? With enough money, you can
buy adventure, fame, glory, and honor and still have
enough left over for dinner at a fancy restaurant.
When you earn cosmic credits, you set them in front of you
face down to keep your total hidden.

PREPARING FOR LAUNCH:
Right now, you do not need to read on.
Go build your first ship.

things wrong with
this ship.

WHAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU:
Hits to Your Ship
A box in the corner of the game board depicts the possible
dangers your ship might face. Each threat comes from
a certain direction in a specific row or column. This will be
explained in greater detail later, but here is a summary:
You can protect your ship from small
meteors by building it well (they just
bounce off unless they hit an exposed
connector) or by using a shield (which
will cost you 1 battery token).
You can protect your ship from large
meteors by shooting them with a
cannon.
You can protect your ship from light
cannon fire with a shield (which will cost
you 1 battery token).
Nothing protects your ship from heavy
cannon fire.
If your ship is hit (because you can't or won't protect it) the
component that was hit must be removed. This might cause
some other components to become disconnected. Remove them
as well. If your ship is broken into two pieces, you decide which
piece you will pilot to your destination and which piece will be lost.
max -5
Lost components are placed in your
discard pile, on the right side of your ship
board. When you reach your destination,
you will have to forfeit 1 cosmic credit for
each lost component. Any playing pieces (crew, battery tokens,
goods) on lost components are returned to the bank.
Don't worry about the crew members in those cabins
that were blasted away. Should the cabin experience
a loss of pressure, stasis cocoons will drop from
overhead compartments and wrap them up safely
until they are rescued. They are the lucky ones,
really. Think of the thousands of years of interest that
will have accumulated in their bank accounts by the
time someone finds them.
Gaining and Losing Flight Days
Some cards have a number in the lower right
corner. This tells how many days you will lose if
you use the card. Whenever you lose flight days,
voluntarily or not, move your marker back that
many empty spaces.
If Blue loses 3 flight days, he will end up in the space just in
front of Red.
Similarly, when you gain flight days, move your marker that
many empty spaces forward. There can never be two
markers on the same space.
Getting Goods
When a card enables you
to load goods onto your
ship, take the indicated colored blocks from the
bank and place them in your cargo containers.
(Each cargo hold has 1 to 3 containers.) Each
container can only hold 1 block. Excess goods
have to be dumped into space (returned to the
bank). The price list will help you decide what to
keep and what to dump.
Red blocks are the most valuable, but they are
hazardous materials and must be kept in the
reinforced containers found in special cargo
holds. If you don't have enough reinforced
containers, you have to discard excess red
blocks.
As long as you have enough space, you should
take everything you can get  even if you have
to put cheap goods in special cargo holds.
When you load new goods, you can always
re-arrange or discard any amount of cargo.
Dumping goods into space is a violation
of anti-littering laws, punishable by fines and
imprisonment. Under no circumstances should you
ever tell the authorities that we were the ones who
recommended that you do this.
Loss of Goods or Crew
-2 If a card requires you to give up goods, you must
return the most valuable goods to the bank. If
you don't have enough goods to cover the
indicated loss, you must give up green battery
tokens to make up the difference. Once you are
out of goods and battery tokens, they can't take
any more from you.
-3 If a card requires you to give up crew,
return that many figures to the bank. If
you don't have enough, just give up all you
have. (In the full game, not having enough
crew to meet the card's requirement
would be a bigger problem.)

THE FLIGHT:
The test flight shows who built the best ship. It consists of 8 adventure cards. (In the
full game, these cards will be chosen at random, but for your first flight, we use the 8
with asterisks to ensure that you will meet with every type of event.) The adventure
cards have various effects.

PARAMETERS OF YOUR SHIP:
Sometimes you have to count up the strength of your engines
or cannons.
Double engines and double cannons need power. Each time
you have to calculate the strength of your engines or cannons,
you must decide which double engines or cannons you will
power and spend batteries for them.
Engine Strength
+1 +2 Each simple engine counts as 1.
Each double engine on which you spend a
green battery token counts as 2.
Cannon Strength
+1 +2
+0,5 +0,5
+1 +1
Each forward-pointing simple cannon
counts as 1.
Each forward-pointing double cannon on
which you spend a green battery token
counts as 2.
Each cannon pointing to the side or to
the rear counts at only half value (1/2
for a simple cannon or 1 for a double
cannon on which you spend a green
token).

ADVENUTURE CARDS:

OPEN SPACE:
Open Space is like a wide open drag strip.
The leader announces the strength of his or
her engines. (See Parameters of Your Ship
above.) The leader must decide whether or
not to spend battery tokens on any double
engines. Then the leader moves his or her
marker ahead a number of spaces equal to
the engine strength.
In order, each player decides which engines to power,
announces strength, and moves his or her ship forward that
many empty spaces. Any player overtaking another will pass
him or her because occupied spaces are not counted. (See
What Can Happen to You  Gaining and Losing Flight Days,
above.)

PLANETS:
A Planets card has 2 to 4 rows of goods
representing planets where you can land to
pick up goods. Landing on a planet will cost
you the number of flight days indicated in the
lower right corner. If you want to land, place
your marker (the extra one that is sitting in
front of you) on the planet you choose. Only
one player's marker is allowed per row.
The leader chooses first, followed by the other players
in order. No player is required to land. In fact, if there are
few planets, the players in the lead may occupy all of them,
preventing the others from landing at all.
The players who chose to land load the indicated goods on
their ships. Goods can be re-arranged or discarded at this
time. (See What Can Happen to You  Gaining Goods, above.)
It is legal to land just to take the opportunity away from other
players, even if you can't take any of the goods (but be sure it
is worth the loss of flight days).
You are paying for these goods, not stealing them, but
it is hard to tell the difference. The cost to you is only
an insignificant fraction of a credit. The natives are
willing to accept any artifacts of civilization in trade
glass beads, carbonated beverages, a video chip with
a copy of the latest installment of their favorite soap
opera.
Once everyone has decided whether to land, those who
landed move their markers back that many empty spaces with
the player who is farthest behind moving first. (See What
Can Happen to You  Gaining and Losing Flight Days, above.)
The leader (initially, the player with tile number 1) turns up the first adventure card. This
card is dealt with as described below or on the following pages. (Each adventure will come
up once, so you can read about them one-at-a-time as the cards are turned up.) Next, the
leader (which may be a different player if the adventure mixed up the order) turns up the
next card, and so on, until all eight adventures have occurred.

ABANDONED SHIP:
If you find an abandoned ship, you're in
gravy! There is some sort of protocol for
reporting these things, but what the heck.
Surely some of your crew are sick of you by
now and have been saving for a ship of their
own. Fix up the abandoned ship and sell it to
them for a fair price.
Only one player can use this opportunity.
The leader decides first. He or she can return the specified
number of crew figures to the bank and take the indicated
number of cosmic credits. This also costs a certain number
of flight days. (See What Can Happen to You  Gaining and
Losing Flight Days, above.)
If the leader chooses not to take advantage of the opportunity, it
falls to the next player in line, and so on. Once someone decides
to fix up the space ship, the remaining players are out of luck.
Sometimes you'll find a ship that you'll be tempted
to keep for yourself. Don't be greedy. Let the crew
have it. There's probably a reason that ship was
abandoned.

ABANDONED STATION:
When fleeing the tragic disaster that befell
this space station, the inhabitants probably
left behind some good loot. It will take a big
crew to search for it, though. To use this
opportunity, you must have at least as many
crew on board as required by the card.
Only one player can use this opportunity.
The leader decides first. If the leader has
enough crew, he or she can dock and get to work. If the leader
can't or won't, the opportunity falls to the next person in line,
and so on. Once someone decides to dock, the others are out
of luck.
When you dock with a space station, take the indicated goods
and place them on your ship. (You can re-arrange or discard
goods. See What Can Happen to You  Gaining Goods.) Move
your marker back the indicated number of empty spaces. (See
What Can Happen to You  Gaining and Losing Flight Days.)
Note that on an abandoned space station you lose no crew.
(The crew symbol does not have a minus sign, as it does on an
abandoned ship.)

METEORIC SWARM:
A meteoric swarm can really mess with
your paint job. This card depicts several
large and/or small meteors and the
directions they come from. Meteors are
dealt with one at a time. They affect every
player simultaneously.
For each meteor, the leader rolls two dice.
The roll determines which row or column
the meteor can impact (rows for meteors with left or right
arrows, columns for meteors with up or down arrows).
The row and column numbers are given on the edge of your
ship board. Each player checks to see which component is
threatened by the meteor. For some die rolls, it could miss
your ship entirely. If it does not, proceed as follows:
A small meteor will harmlessly bounce off of a well
built ship. It is only a problem if it hits an exposed
connector (pipes pointing out in the direction from
which the meteor is coming). In this case, you can
still avoid damage by powering up a shield if you
have one that protects that side. You must pay 1
green battery token to do this. If you can't or won't
avoid the impact, the component the meteor hits
is removed from your ship. (See What Can Happen
to You  Getting Hit, above.)
A large meteor is, of course, even more
dangerous. It will damage even a well built ship and
shields cannot stop it. Your only hope is to blast
it. You can only shoot it if you have a cannon pointed
at it in the same column. If it is a double cannon,
you will have to pay 1 green battery token to use it.
Large meteors tend to come from in front of you,
which is why we recommended you pay special
attention to cannons pointing forward.
If you don't shoot a large meteor, the component
it hits is removed from your ship. (See What Can
Happen to You  Getting Hit, above.)

ENEMIES (SMUGGLERS, SLAVERS, PIRATES):
Enemies pose a threat to everyone, but
they attack the players' ships in order. First,
they attack the leader. If they win, they
attack the next player in line, and so on,
until they have attacked everyone or until
someone defeats them.
These cards are divided into two parts. In
the darker top half is shown what happens
to you if you lose. (If you lose to the smugglers, you must give
up 2 goods  the most valuable ones.) In the lighter bottom
half is shown what you get if you win. (If you defeat smugglers,
you win the indicated goods.)
The strength of the enemy is given by the number next to the
cannon symbol. (These smugglers have strength 4.)
The leader counts the strength of his or her ship (paying for
any double cannons used). If this strength is greater than the
enemy's, the player wins and claims the reward. This costs
a certain number of flight days specified in the lower right
corner. (See What Can Happen to You  Gaining and Losing
Flight Days.) If a player wins, the enemies go away and the
remaining players are not attacked.
If the player loses (has a lower strength than the enemy), he
or she pays the penalty specified in the upper half of the card.
In case of a tie (when the player has strength equal to the
enemy's) nothing happens to the player. In either of these last
two cases, the undefeated enemy moves on to attack the
next player in line, according to the same rules.
Red is the leader. He could have
a strength of 5 (2 for simple
cannons, 2 for the double
cannon pointing forward, 1 for
the double cannon pointing to
the side) but this would cost
2 battery tokens and he only
has 1. He decides to use it,
giving him a strength of 4,
which matches the smugglers.
The result is a tie and nothing
happens to red.
Green is next in line. By paying
2 battery tokens, she has
strength 4 1/2. This is enough
to defeat the smugglers
and take 2 of their goods.
(She discards the blue block
because she can't fit it on her
ship.) She also moves her ship
back 1 empty space.
Blue is lucky to have been
flying last. He can't make his
strength go higher than 3,
so if no one ahead of him had
defeated the smugglers, he
would have lost his goods.

COMBAT ZONE:
The true test of any space ship is to fly it
through a combat zone. The Combat Zone
card has 3 lines which are evaluated in
succession. Each line gives a criterion and
a penalty for the player who is weakest in
that area. (If multiple players are tied for
being weakest, the one who is farthest
ahead pays the penalty.)
The only remaining combat zones are in the
barbarous regions of the Periphery. War-time
activities that harm thinking creatures or machines
have been outlawed by the New New New Geneva
Convention, so war has lost a lot of its punch. And
really, it has always been more effective to fill the
enemy's economy with cheap goods than to fill his
sky with battleships.
First, the player with the fewest crew figures loses 3 flight
days. (See What Can Happen to You  Gaining and Losing
Flight Days.)
Next, the player with the weakest engines (see Parameters
of Your Ship  Engine Strength) loses two crew members.
Players count up their engine strength in order, starting with
the leader, deciding whether or not to spend battery tokens
on double engines.
Yellow has engine
strength 3. He has no
double engines, so he has
no decisions to make.
Green can have engine
strength 1, 3, or 5, depending
on whether she spends
0, 1, or 2 battery tokens.
Yellow is ahead, so if they are tied for strength, Yellow
will have to pay the penalty and green player will not.
Green only needs to spend 1 battery token.
Finally, the player with the weakest cannons (see Parameters
of Your Ship  Cannon Strength) is threatened by light cannon
fire from behind and heavy cannon fire from behind. Again,
players decide in order, starting with the leader, which double
cannons they will pay for.
Hits from cannon fire work like hits from meteors (see
Meteoric Swarm) except they are more difficult to defend
against. Each hit has a direction. The player rolls two dice to
determine which row or column the hit is coming from, thus
determining which component of the ship (if any) is in danger.
The only way to defend against light cannon fire is
with a shield that protects against hits from
that direction. This can be powered at the cost of
1 green battery token. Otherwise, the component
is destroyed. (See What Can Happen to You  Hits
to Your Ship.)
There is no way to defend against heavy
cannon fire. Your only hope against it is to roll
high enough or low enough that it misses your
ship entirely. Otherwise, the component it hits
is destroyed. (See What Can Happen to You
Hits to Your Ship.)

SPECIAL EVENT: STARDUST:
Lose 1 flight day
for each exposed
connector.
Yellow cards are special events. Their
effect is written on the card.
The Stardust event says that every player
loses 1 flight day for every exposed
connector. (Each exposed connector only
counts once, regardless of whether it is
simple, double, or universal.) Starting with
the last player, each player counts his or
her exposed connectors and moves his or her marker back
that many empty spaces. (See What Can Happen to You
Gaining and Losing Flight Days.)

REWARDS AND PENALTIES:
The information in the center of the flight board depicts the
rewards and penalties you receive at the end of your flight.
You should deal with these in order from left to right: first
bonuses, then sale of goods, and finally penalties.
Bonuses
The rules box in the center of the game board depicts the
bonuses available for Round 1.
4-3-2-1
The numbers separated by dashes
tell how many credits you get based
on the order in which you land at
your destination. So, after the last
adventure card has been dealt with,
the leader gets 4 cosmic credits,
the second place finisher gets 3,
and so on.
[+2 ]
The number in square brackets gives the
bonus for the player who lands with the bestlooking
ship. Count up the number of exposed
connectors on your ships. (Each exposed
connector only counts once, regardless of
whether it is simple, double, or universal.)
Whoever has the fewest gets the indicated
bonus. (If there is a tie for the fewest, all
those players receive the bonus.)
Goods
Return all your
goods to the
bank, and take the
number of cosmic
credits indicated
by the price list.
Losses
Now you have to deliver the components
of your ship to Corporation Incorporated.
For each component you lost along the
way you lose 1 cosmic credit. (When you
lost components, you placed them in the
discard pile on your space ship board, so it
is easy to keep track of how many you lost.)
Fortunately, the Department of Stellar
Vehicles requires every space ship to be
insured, so there is a limit to how much
you can lose. This maximum is given in
the discard area of your ship board. (For Class I ships, the
limit is 5 cosmic credits.) Even if you lost more components
than this, you only have to pay this many cosmic credits.
Pangalactic Insurance Company will pay the difference to
Corp Inc. just as soon as they can get a claims adjuster out to
the edge of the Galaxy.
However, if you lose over twice this many components ...
well, then you still just pay the maximum. But Corporation
Incorporated will fire the guy who signed you up for this job.
How you assuage your guilty conscience is up to you.
It is well known that matter warps space.
Less well advertised is that documents warp truth.
A Pangalactic Insurance policy, which takes into
consideration such factors as time dilation, the
Fitzgerald contraction, and the Doppler effect, is the
legal equivalent of a black hole: everyone's money
gets sucked in, and none of it ever comes back out.

THE END OF THE ROUND:
Congratulations on completing your first flight. Return all
tokens, blocks, and figures to the bank. Take all your space
ship components except your pilot cabin and put them in
the Warehouse pile in the center of the table. The adventure
cards can be returned to the box: in the next rounds you will
be using different cards.
Keep your cosmic credits. You should stack them in a tidy pile
face down in front of you so that no one else can see them.
(The other players should be trying to make their own money,
not staring longingly at yours.)
Now you can read the full rules and either play Rounds 2 and
3 or start a new game from the beginning.

JOURNEY'S END:
Your trip is over once the last of the eight adventure cards has been dealt with.

SET UP:
In each round, use the ship boards with the corresponding
number. (In Round 3, use board III, not IIIa.)
The shape requirements for ships of classes I, II, and
III were established by the Aldebaran Accord, which
resolved several decades of conflict between the
Union of Trans-Galactic Engineers and the Science
Fiction Writers Association.
II II I
Before you start building your
ships, get out the flight board and
set it near the Warehouse. If this is
the start of Round 2 or Round 3,
find the appropriate rules card and
place it on the board over top of the
rules for Round 1.

ADVENTURE CARDS:
In the full game, you may take advantage of Corporation
Incorporated's prognostics division and look at the adventure
cards while you are building your ship.
Before everyone starts grabbing for components, make three
piles of adventure cards, chosen at random, and place them
on the indicated squares on the flight board. Each pile should
contain the cards depicted in the lower left corner of the rules
card. Each pile contains 2 cards from the deck corresponding to
the current round and 1 card from each lower-numbered deck.
Looking at Cards
If you have added at least one component to your ship, you can
take a break from building and pick up any one of the three
piles to look through those cards. When you return them, you
can resume building or look through another pile. You can look
at a pile for as long as you like, and you can pick it up as often
as you like. Be sure to return each pile to the place where you
picked it up to make it easier for everyone to tell which piles
they have seen already.
Of course, looking at the cards takes up time that could be
spent grabbing components, but the information on what you
might encounter in that part of the Galaxy can be very helpful.
(For example, if you see a lot of planets, you might want more
cargo holds.)
Preparing the Adventure Cards
When everyone is done building, you add a pile of cards that
no one has seen yet. Make a fourth pile of cards the same
way you made the other three. Put all four piles together and
shuffle thoroughly. If the number on the top card does not
match the number of the round, keep shuffling until it does.
(This won't be an issue in Round 1, of course.)
It is theoretically possible to predict everything that
happens to you, but it is forbidden by the Department
of Antiperfectionism's "Preservation of Suspense on
Space Flights" regulations.
In Round 1, you will have three piles of two cards each. When
you mix in the fourth pile, you will have 8 cards, just as you
did in the test flight. In later rounds, you will have more cards
because they are longer flights.

THE TIMER:
Saying "Go!"
II
In Round 1, the boldest player says "Go!"
In Rounds 2 and 3, this role falls to the
player who landed first in the previous
round. In addition to saying "Go!" this
player must start the timer and put it in
the circle on the flight board that
corresponds to the round number.
Turning Over the Timer
The timer measures how much time is left for building ships.
When time runs out, any player may turn the timer over and
place it on the next circle (from a higher number to a lower).
Usually, this is done by someone who is progressing well and
doesn't want to give the others a chance to catch up.

FULL RULES:
The following text assumes that you have already made your first flight. This section
gives only the additional rules that are used in the full game. Use these rules for Rounds
2 and 3 in your first game. In later games, you use these rules in Round 1 as well.
The Last Flip
start
When the time runs out on the timer
sitting in circle number 1, it can be flipped
over one last time and set in the circle
marked "Start". However, only a player
who has finished building and taken a
numbered tile may do this.
The last flip measures how much time the
rest of the players have to complete their ships. When that
time runs out, no one can add another component. Everyone
stops building and takes a numbered tile. (The lowest
numbered remaining tile goes to whoever grabs it first.)
In Round 1 of a full game, the situation is as follows: the
boldest player sets the timer on circle 1 while saying "Go!"
The first player to finish building takes tile number 1. By this
time, the timer has probably run out, so the player turns it
over and sets it on the circle labeled "Start", thus giving the
other players their final countdown. (If it is still running, of
course, the player has to wait until it is done.)
In Round 2, the timer starts on circle 2. When it runs out,
anyone can turn it over and place it on circle 1. You can't flip it
over from circle 2 directly to the "Start" circle, not even if you
have finished building and taken a numbered tile. You have to
let it run out in circle 1 first.

SETTING COMPONENTS ASIDE:
While building, you can have up to two
components set aside. These go in the
upper right corner of your ship board
(i.e., your discard pile). No one can take
these from you, but you cannot return them to the
Warehouse. The only thing you can do with them is add them
to your ship. When you add one of them, you have room to set
a new component aside, but you can never have more than
two set aside at one time. If you set aside a component and
then fail to add it to your ship, you leave it in your discard pile.
It counts against you at the end of your trip as a component
lost along the way.
No one cares that the components are still lying there
at the launch site, nor that this junk is only worth
a fraction of the penalty Corp Inc. charges you for
losing it. A contract is a contract.

ALIENS:
Life Support Components
So what are those funny components that we
refused to explain earlier? The orange and
purple components are life support systems for
aliens.
In order for the life support system to have
any effect, it must join with a cabin. This
makes the cabin inhabitable by aliens of the
corresponding color. (But you can't put an alien
in your starting component, the pilot cabin.)
Humans, in grey space suits, don't need any
special life support components, and can go
in any cabin.
Placing the Crew
Crew figures are placed according to the following rules:
The pilot cabin gets 2 humans. (Neither of these is "you".
But they will be your close roommates on a long voyage,
so after a while you might start thinking they are you.)
A cabin that is not joined to a life support system gets
2 humans.
A cabin joined to a life support system gets 2 humans or
1 alien of the corresponding color.
A cabin joined to one life support system of each color gets
either 2 humans or 1 purple alien or 1 orange alien.
Your ship can have no more than 1 alien of each color.
Possibilities for placing crew.
Players decide how to place their crew one at a time, starting
with the player with tile 1.
Alien Abilities
Aliens are crew members and are counted as such in a
Combat Zone or an Abandoned Station. You can send them
away on an Abandoned Ship or give them up to Slavers.
The disadvantage of taking an alien on board is that it takes
up the space of two humans. But, of course, there are some
advantages.
Purple aliens are a war-like species. If you have a
purple alien, you get +2 to cannon strength. (If your
cannon strength without the alien is 0, you don't get
this bonus. It's not going to fight a space battle with
its bare teeth.)
Orange aliens are good mechanics. If you have an
orange alien, you get +2 to engine strength. (If your
engine strength without the alien is 0, you don't get
this bonus. It's not going to get out and push.)
Hits on Life Support Systems
If your ship loses a life support system and this leaves an alien
in a cabin that can no longer support it, return the alien to the
bank. (It leaves in an emergency escape pod, of course.)
SHIP BUILDING MISTAKES
If you find that you have added a piece illegally, there is nothing
you can do (unless you just put it there and have not picked
up a new one). The problem will be dealt with during the spot
check, before launch.
Spot Check
The penalty for an illegal ship is much harsher in the full
game. During the spot check, make sure that your ship is built
according to the rules. If your ship is in violation, you have to
remove one or more components so that the result conforms
to the rules. This does not count as extra building (you keep
your number tile) but you can't add any new components. The
removed pieces are placed in the pile of components lost
along the way. You will have to pay a penalty for them when
you reach your destination.
This ship has a mistake. To fix it, the player must remove
either the cabin or the battery. He wants to put an alien in the
cabin, so he removes the battery. When he does so, he also
loses one of the engines. Both components are placed in his
discard pile on his ship board.
Flaws Discovered During Flight
If someone discovers that your ship is illegal in flight (any time
after the first adventure card has been revealed) you must
immediately correct the mistake as described above and pay
1 cosmic credit to the bank for violating the laws of physics.

ADVANCED ENEMIES:
In the full game, you will also encounter Pirates and Slavers.
When you defeat them you don't gain goods; you gain cold,
hard cosmic credits. Move your ship back the indicated
number of empty spaces and take the credits from the bank.
If you don't want to lose flight days, you can choose not to take
the credits (or goods in the case of Smugglers) and leave your
ship where it is. Either way, no other player may collect the
reward once the enemy has been defeated.
If the Slavers defeat you, they force you to
give up some of your crew. You choose
which humans or aliens to surrender in
exchange for your own freedom.
If the Pirates defeat you, your ship gets
shot at. (The card indicates the size and
direction of the cannon fire.) Keep track of
all the players who were defeated and then
have the first defeated player roll two dice
to determine the row or column of each
shot. This roll applies to all defeated players.
Light cannon fire can only be stopped by a
shield oriented in the correct direction and
powered by a battery. Heavy cannon fire
cannot be stopped. (See Combat Zone.)

METEORIC SWARM:
In later rounds, meteors can come at your
ship from the left or right. Large meteors
coming from in front of you can only be
blown up by a forward-pointing cannon in
the column from which they are
approaching, but large meteors from the
side can be blown up by a cannon pointing
toward that side in the same row or in an
adjacent row. (The ship accelerates or
decelerates just enough to shoot the meteor.) This doesn't
apply to small meteors, which are too small to be hit by
cannon fire.
Most space craft are protected from meteors by
autotargeting gun turrets, self-guided missiles, or
disintegration fields. Yours is protected by cannons
made from sewer drills.

SPECIAL EVENTS:
Each occupied
cabin joined to another
occupied cabin loses
1 crew member.
An Epidemic can strike in Round 2 or 3. This
adventure card makes you remove 1 crew
member (human or alien) from every
occupied cabin that is joined to another
occupied cabin. The safe thing to do is to
build your ship so that no two cabins are
joined. If you do have connected cabins, you
can try to empty one of them before the
epidemic strikes. (It is very helpful to know if
Epidemic is among the adventure cards for that round.)
The player with the
fewest crew members
loses 1 ship component
at random. (Roll for it.
If 3 rolls fail to select a
component on the ship,
the saboteur gives up.)
Sabotage can occur in Round 3. This
adventure card blows up a random
component on the ship with the smallest
crew. (If multiple ships are tied for smallest
crew, the one in front is sabotaged.) To
select the component, the affected player
rolls 2 dice to determine the column and 2
dice to determine the row. If there is no
component at those coordinates, roll again
for new coordinates. If there is no component there, roll
again. If three sets of coordinates are rolled without hitting a
component, the saboteurs give up and nothing happens.
If the saboteurs blow up a component, it is set aside as lost in
flight, as are any others that fall off as a result of this loss. A
hit to the center of the ship can be devastating.

GIVING UP:
In the full game, you might have to give up before you reach
your destination. Sometimes you might even choose to give
up. Fortunately, you can always find a Corp Inc. warehouse
nearby.
If you give up:
Remove your marker from the game board. You are just a
spectator for the rest of the round and none of the cards
can affect you.
You don't get any bonuses for the order in which you
finished (because you didn't finish, obviously). When giving
bonuses for the ship with the fewest exposed connectors,
your ship does not count.
You do get to sell your goods, but only at half the total
price. Add up the total full sale price of all your goods and
take half that many credits. (Round up.)
You have to pay the penalty for the components you
lost along the way. (Anything you haven't lost yet can be
returned to Corp Inc. without penalty, so only pay for
those in your discard pile. Don't forget that there is a limit
to how big your penalty can be.)
If you are the only one left after everyone else has given
up, you can keep going and try to go through the remaining
adventures by yourself. In this case, ignore the Combat Zone
and Sabotage adventures (which penalize the player with the
fewest engines, cannons, or crew members).
Losing All Humans
You have to give up if an adventure card leaves you
without any humans on board. (Aliens can't run the ship by
themselves.) This could be due to taking a hit that destroys
your last occupied cabin, to losing crew after encountering
a Combat Zone or Slavers, or to voluntarily sending your last
crew member off on an Abandoned Ship. If this happens in a
Combat Zone, you cannot withdraw your ship from the race
until all effects of the card have been dealt with.
Open Space without Engines
Thanks to inertia, your ship can finish the journey even
without engines as long as you don't encounter Open
Space. When confronted by an Open Space card, you have
to give up if your engine strength is zero (which could be due
to having no engines or to having only double engines and
no battery power left). Don't forget that the orange alien
does not add to your engine strength when you have none
to begin with.
Getting Lapped
If the leader laps you (i.e., you are more than 1 full circle
behind) you must give up.
Choosing to Give Up
Sometimes, it might be better to give up and cut your losses.
You can decide to give up, but you must do so before the next
adventure card is revealed. (If you decide to give up after
seeing an adventure card, you must suffer through that
adventure first.)

SHORTER GAME:
With experienced players, a full game usually takes about an
hour. For a shorter game, you can just play one or two rounds.
It is up to you whether to leave out the shorter rounds or the
longer rounds.
ROUND 3A
Experienced players can make the game longer and more
challenging by playing an extra round. The extra round is
played according to the Round 3 rules using ships of Class
IIIa. (You may have noted that this board has no discard area.
You can just keep your discarded components beside your
board. These ships are uninsurable, so you must pay for every
component you lose. There is no maximum penalty.)
You can also leave out Round 3 and just play 3a.
MORE FORESIGHT
If you have good memories and like planning ahead, use the
following rules:
Don't mix up the three stacks of adventure cards. Don't
change their order when you look at them during building.
Don't shuffle them together once everyone is done building.
Instead, just stack them neatly on top of each other and put
the fourth stack (with cards no one has seen) on the bottom.
Now you know what will happen and when (except for the last
set of cards).

TEAM PLAY:
After playing several games, you will find yourself becoming
much swifter at grabbing tiles and building your ship. This can
cause problems when introducing new players to the game.
The final timer will run out before they are done building and
they will have worse ships than they would have if they were
just playing against each other. It's not much fun to fly through
space in a half-built ship. Team play can help fix this problem.
This variant is for four people. The most experienced player
should be partnered with the least experienced player, and the
remaining two players form the other team. Partners should
sit across from each other. The game is played according to
the usual rules with two exceptions:
1. Partners keep their cosmic credits together in one pile.
2. After building, you fly your partner's ship.
The beginner will see what it is like to fly a well built ship and
you can nostalgicly re-live your first space flights, when it was
a great accomplishment just to get to the finish. Your partner
will get better quickly. The desire to build you a good ship
can be better motivation than the struggle to keep up with
experienced players in a standard game.
Team Play for Experienced Players
Team play can be fun for experienced players. It adds new
tactical elements, such as deciding whether it is better to use
an opportunity yourself or to leave it for your partner.
You can just play as described above or you can use this
shared ship building rule: When the timer is moved from one
numbered circle to another, the player who does so calls out
"switch". Each player must move to the opposite side of the
table and build on the ship his or her partner was working
on. There is no switch when the timer is moved from circle
1 to the "Start" circle, so you will not switch during building in
Round 1. You will switch once in Round 2 and twice in Round
3. After building, you switch one more time to go fly your
partner's ship, as you do in standard team play (so you will still
get your exercise even in Round 1).
You will have to find your bearings quickly to be able to figure
out what your partner was working on and what the ship needs
for completion. The resulting ship will truly be a team effort.
Your goal was to make money, and you did.
So what if some other jokers made more?
Of course, the player who has the most credits is a bit more
of a winner than everyone else.

VARIANTS:

THE WINNERS:
The game ends after Round 3, once all the rewards have been collected and all the
penalties paid. Add up all your cosmic credits. If that number is 1 or more, you win!
What if I don't have enough credits to pay
my penalty at the end of a round?
Just return all your credits to the bank. You will start the next
round (if there is one) with zero.
Yes, we did say you would be up to your ears in
debt. That was just to scare you. The truth is that
the science of bankruptcy is advancing faster than
subquantum physics. Because of the number of ways
to hide money in accounts belonging to your children,
your spouses, and your clones, there is no way you
can ever be in debt.
What if I am the first to finish building, but
I don't want to start out in front?
When you are done building, you can take any of the remaining
numbers. If the first player to finish does not take tile number
1, it will be there for someone else to take.
Can I decide not to use a simple engine or
simple cannon?
No. Simple motors, simple cannons, and bonuses for aliens
are always added in. The only thing you can decide is whether
to use a double engine or double cannon (and pay 1 battery
token for it). (Similarly, you decide whether to use shields.)
Can I shoot a big meteor with a cannon in
the middle of my ship?
Yes. Your cannon must be pointed in the right direction and
be in the same column as the meteor (against a big meteor
coming from ahead) or in the same row or one of the two
adjacent rows (against a big meteor coming from the side).
Of course, the square in front of the cannon's barrel must be
empty; otherwise it is an illegal ship.
What if I have exposed connectors inside
my ship?
If your ship has a hole in the middle, connectors adjacent to the
hole still count as exposed connectors. They are protected
from meteors, however, because the meteor will strike the
first component in the given row or column.
Can I decide which block, figure, or token
to give up?
Yes. When forced to discard goods, you must discard the
most expensive ones first, but when choosing between two of
the same color, you decide. When giving up crew, you decide
whether to give up aliens or humans and which cabins they
will come from. Similarly, you decide which batteries to use. It
is recommended to first use up the parts of the ship you are
most likely to lose.
Can I re-arrange goods, crew, and batteries
at any time?
No. The only things you can re-arrange are goods, and these
can only be re-arranged when you gain new ones.
What if the bank runs out of goods?
If the bank runs out of goods of the type you are supposed
to load, you are out of luck. You don't get them. On planets,
players should load goods in order, starting with the leader.
(If one player discards goods during loading, the discarded
goods will be available for the players who load after.)
What if the bank runs out of crew figures
or battery tokens?
In this case, look under the table. There should be enough
crew figures to fill every cabin and enough battery tokens to
fill every battery. (If you find there are not enough aliens to go
around, that might be because you forgot that your ship can
only have one alien of each type.)
Where can I get the electronic version?
Just about anywhere. Visit galaxytrucker.com to find download

GAME NAME:
COUP

Coup Rules
Number of players: 3-6

OBJECT:
To be the only player with any influence cards left.

MATERIALS:
Deck of influence cards, bank of coins.

SET-UP:
Shuffle the cards and deal two to each player. Players should look at their cards but keep them
hidden from everyone else. Each player takes two coind from the bank as their starting wealth.

CARDS:
There are five different characters in the influence deck (three copies of each character). Each
of the five characters has one or more special abilities. The Duke (takes taxes and Blocks Foreign Aid),
the Assassin (forces one player to give up an Influence card), the Captain (steals two coins from
another player, Blocks stealing attempts), Ambassador (lets you swap or appear to swap your Influence
cards with new ones from the deck, Blocks stealing attempts), the Countessa (Blocks assassination
attempts).

PLAY:
Starting with the player to the left of the dealer and going clockwise, players take turns
performing one of the available actions.
1. Income: Take one coin from the bank. This cannot be Challenged or Blocked.
2. Foreign Aid: Take two coins from the bank. This cannot be Challenged but it can be Blocked by
the Duke.
3. Coup: Costs seven coins. Cause a player to give up an Influence card. Cannot be Challenged or
Blocked. If you start your turn with 10+ coins, you must take this action.
4. Taxes (the Duke): Take three coins from the bank. Can be Challenged.
5. Assassinate (the Assassin): Costs three coins. Force one player to give up an Influence card of
their choice. Can be Challenged. Can be Blocked by the Contessa.
6. Steal (the Captain): Take two coins from another player. Can be Challenged. Can be Blocked by
another Captain or an Ambassador.
7. Swap Influence (the Ambassador): Draw two Influence cards from the deck, look at them and
mix them with your current Influence card(s). Place two cards back in the deck and shuffle the
deck. Can be Challenged. Cannot be Blocked.
Blocking: If another player takes an action that can be Blocked, any other player may Block it by
claiming to have the proper character on one of their Influence cards. The acting player cannpt perform
the action and takes no other action this turn. The acting player MAY choose to Challenge the Blocking
player. If they win the Challenge, the action goes through as normal.

CHALLENGE:
When the acting player declares their action, any other player may Challenge their right to
take the action. They are saying "I don't believe you have the proper character to do that." The acting
player now must prove they have the power to take the action or lose the Challenge. If they have the
right character, they reveal it and place the revealed card back in the deck. They then shuffle the deck
and draw a new card. The Challenging player has lost the Callenge. If the do NOT have the proper
character, they lose the Challenge.

LOSING A CHALLENGE:
Any player who loses a Challenge must turn one of their Influence cards face up
for all to see. If that is their last Influence card, they are out of the game.

LOSING AN INFLUENCE:
Any time a player loses an Influence card, THEY choose which of their cards to
reveal.



GAME NAME: SCYTHE

Stonemaier Games presents

GOAL:
The goal is to have the greatest fortune at the end of the game;
a typical winning fortune is around $75. You can accumulate
coins during the game, but you will earn most of them during
end-game scoring in the following three categories:
Every star token placed
Every territory controlled
Every 2 resources controlled
The amount of coins you earn depends on your level on the
Popularity Track. The higher your popularity, the more coins
you will earn. You can also get a few bonus coins based on
where you built structures.

DESIGNED BY:
JAMEY STEGMAIER

ART AND WORLDBUILDING BY JAKUB ROZALSKI

1-5 PLAYERS  115 MINUTES
Scythe is a board game set in an alternate-history 1920s.
It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor.

BACKSTORY:
The ashes from the first Great War still darken the snow in 1920s Europa. The capitalistic city-state known simply as "The F actory,"
which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the atetntion of several nearby countries.
With characters from five factions converging onto a small but highly desired swath of land, who will gain fame and
fortune by establishing their empire as the leader of Eastern Europa?

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
In Scythe, each player represents a character attempting to
make their faction the richest and most powerful in Eastern
Europa. Players explore and conquer territory, enlist new
recruits, produce resources and workers, build structures,
and deploy monstrous mechs. A game of Scythe typically
begins with players building up their infrastructure,
exploring the world, then engaging each other in combat.
The game progresses as players place stars (achievements)
on the board, and it ends when a player places their 6th star
on the Triumph Track. You can earn a star for accomplishing
any of the following:
Complete all 6 upgrades
Deploy all 4 mechs
Build all 4 structures
Enlist all 4 recruits
Have all 8 workers on
the board
Reveal 1 completed
objective card
Win combat (up to 2 times)
Have 18 popularity
Have 16 power

QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE:
GAME BOARD:
1. Shuffle and place the encounter, combat, and objective cards on
their board spaces.
2. Shuffle factory cards and place as many as the number of players
+1 on the board face-down. Remove the rest from the game.
3. Randomly draw and place face-up one structure bonus tile at the
bottom of the Popularity Track.
4. Place an encounter token on each encounter space ().
5. Separate the resource tokens and coins into the supply.
6. Randomly deal a Faction Mat and a Player Mat to each player.
FACTION MATS
7. Start with the power position () and number of combat cards
( ) shown on your mat.
8. Place your faction character on your faction home base.
9. Place 1 worker on each of the two land-adjoined territories
adjacent to the home base.
10. Place 4 mechs on the mech spaces.
11. Place your 6 star tokens on your Faction Mat.
PLAYER MATS
12. Start with the popularity position () and gain the number of
objective cards () and coins ( ) shown on your mat.
13. Place the 6 technology cubes on the green boxes with black
squares ().
14. Place the 4 structures on their corresponding boxes.
15. Place the 4 recruit tokens on the circle bonus spaces.
16. Place the 6 workers on the red Produce action rectangles.
17. Place your action token next to your Player Mat.
18. The start player is the one with the lowest numbered Player Mat.
Play then proceeds clockwise.

TURN ORDER:
Each player takes a turn by placing the action token on the
corresponding section of the Player Mat. You may take the
top and/or bottom action (in that order). You must choose a
different section of your Player Mat from your previous turn.

TRIUMPH TRACK:
Place a star on the Triumph Track as soon as you complete one
of the requirements. Each achievement may only be awarded
once (note: there are two combat victory achievements). Once
you place a star, it cannot be lost. When a player places a sixth
star, the game immediately ends.

END GAME SCORING:
Gain coins for each star on the Triumph Track, each territory
controlled, and every two resources. The amount of coins for
each is based on your position on the popularity track. The
Factory counts as three territories.
Then gain coins based on the structure bonus tile (even if you
do not control the territory). For adjacent territory bonuses,
only count each adjacent territory once.
The player with the most coins wins. Break ties (in order) by:
number of units and structures, power, popularity, resources
owned, territories controlled, and stars placed.

TURN ORDER, TRIUMPH TRACK, AND END OF GAME:

CONTROL:
A territory is controlled by a player if it has only that player's
units on it or if it has its structure but no enemy units.
A territory with a structure and enemy units is controlled by
the enemy units' player. The enemy units' player does not
gain the structure's abilities.
Resources on a territory are controlled by the player who
controls that territory.

FACTORY ACTION SPACES:
Factory card action spaces do not give bonuses (Recruit,
Structure, etc.) that Player Mat spaces do. The factory Move
action allows one unit to move twice.

OBJECTIVES:
At any time, if you complete an objective on one of your cards,
place a star on the objective space of the Triumph Track and
discard the other objective(s).

CLARIFICATIONS:
RESOURCE: Food, wood, metal, or oil (not workers). You may only
use resources on territories you control to pay costs.
TERRITORY: A non-Home Base hex. The Home Base does not cont
as a territory for any game effects.
UNIT: A character, mech, or worker.

DESIGNER'S NOTE: Why the name "Scythe"? A scythe is
both an instrument of farming and a weapon of
war, which perfectly encapsulates the combination
of those two elements in the game. Your workers rely
on the protection of your military just as much as
your empire depends on the resources they produce.
"Scythe" is pronounced like "sigh" and the soft "th"
in"smooth". +3 +7

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:

HOME BASE:
You have a home base that serves as a starting point and as a place to retreat after losing
combat.
IT'S NOT A TERRITORY: A home base is not a territory, so by default you cannot move units, build
structures, or deploy mechs onto any home base, including your own.
EXPANSION FACTIONS: There are two home bases on the game board without corresponding
pieces. These are placeholders for expansion factions.
CONTROL
You control a territory if you have at least one unit there (a character, worker, or mech) OR
if you have a structure there with no enemy characters, workers, or mechs. Only one player
at a time can control a territory.

RESOURCES:
Resource tokens (wood, food, metal, and oil) remain on the board once produced. You may only spend resources from
territories you currently control.
SPEND RESOURCES FROM ANY TERRITORIES YOU CONTROL: You can spend resources on territories you control for actions related to
territories anywhere on the board. For example, you can spend 3 metal tokens you control on one or more territories to
deploy a mech on the same or a different territory (if you have a worker on that territory).
SUPPLY: When you spend a resource, remove it from the board and place it in the general supply at the side of the board.
When you produce or trade for a resource (details in the Top-Row Actions section, pages 12-13), move it from the supply
to the territory where it was produced. There are no limits to the number of resource tokens in the gameuse multiplier
tokens as needed.
WORKERS AREN'T RESOURCES. Resources are wood, food, metal, and oil. Workers are not resources.

TERRITORY:
A territory is a hex on the
board labeled with one of
the following terrain types:
FARM FOREST
PRIMARY TERRAIN TYPES
MOUNTAIN TUNDRA VILLAGE LAKE FACTORY
EXAMPLE OF RESOURCE CONTROL: In this image, the Nordic
faction controls each of the territories on which
it has one of its units or structures (blue pieces,
including the character miniature with the blue
base). It can spend any of the resources on those
territories. It cannot spend the metal tokens on the
territory on the bottom left because it does not have a
unit or structure there.
Each type of unit also has some unique traits that aren't
shared by the other unit types. These concepts will be
explained in detail later in the rules.

PLASTIC WOOD:
A visual cue in Scythe is that tokens that take part in combat are made out of plastic
(characters and mechs). All other tokens are made out of wood to show that they do not
take part in combat (workers, resources, and structures).
Characters can engage
in combat, can have
encounters, and (once per
game) gain a Factory card
if they end their movement
on the Factory. You are
represented on the board by
your character. You have been
sent on a mission by your
faction's leader to claim the
uncharted lands surrounding
the defunct Factory.
Mechs can engage in
combat and, when moving,
can transport any number
of workers. Mechs cannot
transport your character.
Mechs are built for war (and
for discouraging other factions
from engaging in war with
them), and they're big enough
that they can carry workers
within their iron shells.
Workers can produce
resources and more
workers, deploy mechs, and
build structures. These are
the people of the land who
have joined your cause to
build an empire for you.
Each of the three unit types in the gamecharacters,
mechs, and workersshare two key similarities:
They can move around the board (not over rivers or onto
lakes, by default).
They can transport any number of resource tokens.

TYPES OF UNITS:
BOARD SETUP
SETUP
OBJECTIVE CARDS (BEIGE): Shuffle
the objective cards and put
them on the board.
ENCOUNTER CARDS (GREEN):
Shuffle the encounter
cards and put them on
the board.
COMBAT CARDS (YELLOW): Shuffle
the combat cards and put
them on the board. If a
combat card would need to
be drawn from an empty
deck, first shuffle the
discard pile to create a new
deck. If both the deck and
discard pile are empty, no
cards are drawn.
FACTORY CARDS (PURPLE): Shuffle
the Factory cards and
randomly select X cards
face-down, where X is the
number of players plus 1.
Place those cards on the
board face-down and return
the rest of the Factory cards
to the box without looking
at them.
STRUCTURE BONUS TILE: Randomly select one of the structure
bonus tiles and place it face-up at the bottom of the
Popularity Track.
ENCOUNTER TOKENS (GREEN COMPASS): Place
1 encounter token on each territory
marked with an encounter symbol on
the board (11 total tokens).
RESOURCES AND COINS: Place the resource tokens (wood, oil, food,
and metal), coins, and multiplier tokens in a supply area
next to the board.
FACTION SELECTION:
Randomly shuffle the Faction Mats and Player Mats, then
deal 1 of each to each player. Each player should sit near
the home base for their faction with their Faction Mat
and Player Mat positioned in front of them; the seating
order should be Nordic, Rusviet, Crimea, Saxony, Polania
(Clockwise from top).
TRIUMPH TRACK
POPULARITY TRACK
POWER TRACK

STARTING CARDS AND TRACK POSITIONS:
Both the Faction Mat and Player Mat indicate your starting cards and track positions in the
boxes on the far right of each mat.
POWER TOKEN: Place your
power token ( ) on the
indicated level of the Power
Track (on the game board).
Power is the commodity you
will spend in combat.
COINS: Gain the indicated
amount of coins and place
them on your Faction Mat.
While the number of coins
you have during the game
is not hidden information,
you are never required
to reveal their total value
to other players. The
decisions you make in
Scythe are not impacted
by each of your opponent's
coin totals.

CHARACTER:
Place your character (miniature with the person & animal)
on your faction's home base.

WORKERS:
Place 1 worker on each of the territories connected to your
home base by land (a total of 2 workers).

COMBAT CARDS: Draw the
indicated number of
combat cards. The number
of combat cards you have
is public information,
but the content of those
cards is kept secret from
opponents.

OBJECTIVE CARDS: Draw the
indicated number of
objective cards. The
content of those cards
is kept secret from
opponents. After all
players have drawn their
objective cards, return the
objective deck to the board.
POPULARITY TOKEN: Place your popularity token (heart) on the
indicated level of the Popularity Track on the game board.
ACTION TOKEN: Place your
action token next to
the Player Mat.
DESIGNER'S NOTE: The higher-numbered Player Mats offer
slightly more lucrative starting track positions than the
others, as those players are more likely to have 1 fewer
turn by the end of the game than the player who goes first.

STARTING PLAYER:
The player with the lowest number in the label on their
Player Mat will go first. Play proceeds clockwise from there.
PLAYER MAT
Your Player Mat is where you'll be choosing actions during the game.
TECHNOLOGY CUBES: Put 6 technology cubes on your
Player Mat on the green boxes that have a black
square in the bottom right corner.
EXAMPLE
STRUCTURE TOKENS: Your 4
structure tokens (wooden
buildings: Armory,
Monument, Mine, and
Mill) go on top of the
corresponding boxes.
Each player has the same 4
structures.
RECRUIT TOKENS: Your 4
recruit tokens (cylinders)
go on the circular spaces
on the bottom row of the
Player Mat.
WORKERS: Your remaining 6
workers (meeples) go on
the rectangles above the
Produce action.

FACTION MAT:
Your Faction Mat is where you keep your mechs, stars, and coins. Each Faction Mat also shows a special ability in the
upper right corner.
STARS: Place your 6 star tokens at the upper
left near the faction emblem.
MECHS: Place your 4 mech
miniatures on top of the 4
mech/character abilities.
Do not put tokens on top
of the Recruit One-Time
Bonuses (bottom left
corner)you'll gain these
benefits when enlisting
recruits during the game.

QUICK-START CARD:
We recommend that you don't try to teach every little
rule to new players. Instead, give each player a quickstart
card. This card contains key information about
units on one side, and the other side covers broad
concepts and gives players something specific to do for
their first five turns.
Your first game of Scythe isn't about devising a
masterful plan or understanding every little rule. Just
jump in and start pushing buttons to see how things
work, referring to the rules when necessary.

RIVERWALK CARD:
The riverwalk cardsone per playerare a reminder
as to which factions have the ability to cross into each
home territory if they unlock the Riverwalk mech
ability, as each Riverwalk ability is slightly different.
This ability is explained for each faction on
pages 15  17.

GAMEPLAY:
Scythe uses an ongoing action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases). Players take
turns one after another until a player places their 6th star on the board, immediately
ending the game.
Thus, you may take a single action, both actions (from top
to bottom), or neither action (but you must still move your
action token). You may use resources gained from the toprow
action to pay for the bottom-row action. Also, you may
complete an objective card during your turn (see Objective
section, page 26).
The costs (red boxes) and benefits (green boxes) on your
Player Mat are shown by the number of empty spaces before
the action is taken. When taking an action, first pay the
cost, then gain as much or as little of the benefit as you
wish. You may only take an action once on your turn, not
multiple times.
After you've completed your turn (or as you're finalizing
your decision on a bottom-row actionit is crucial for
turns to overlap in this manner to keep the game moving
at a steady pace), the next person in clockwise order takes
their turn.
On your turn, do the following in sequential order:
1. Place your action token on a different section of your
Player Mat than where it was on your previous turn.
2. Take the top-row action on that section once (optional).
3. Take the bottom-row action on that section once (optional).

BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS
BOLSTER ACTION PRODUCE ACTION MOVE ACTION TRADE ACTION
BOLSTER ACTION

UPGRADE ACTION
(with recruit bonus on
the right)
UPGRADE ACTION DEPLOY ACTION BUILD ACTION ENLIST ACTION

TOP-ROW ACTIONS:
The top-row actions appear in a different order on each Player Mat, though each action is identical. The Player Mat visuals
and the default costs and benefits explained in this section are based on the starting position of each Player Mat.
MOVE
Do one of the following ("/" means
"or"):
MOVE: Move up to 2 different units
you control (character, worker, or
mech) from one territory (or home
base) to one adjacent territory.
Move one, then move the other.
GAIN COIN(S): Gain $1.
Here are some important notes about how movement works:
RESOURCES AND WORKERS: Units may pick up and drop off any
number of resource tokens during a Move action.
MECHS: In addition to resources, your mechs can pick up
and drop off any number of your workers during a Move
action. If they do, this does not count as movement for
the workers, just the mech. So you could transport some
workers on a mech, and then one of those workers could
move on its own. You could also use part of your Move
action to move a worker onto a territory with a mech,
then move the mech while carrying the worker.
RIVERS AND LAKES: By default, units may not move across rivers
or onto lakes. This rule is broken by some mech abilities
(see Mech abilities for Polania and Nordic, pages 16-17).
RIVER: A river is a body of water on the border between two
land territories.
LAKE: A lake is a body of water comprised of an entire
territory hex. It extends from the hex to any adjacent
shoreline. Thus, in the example shown here, if a player
has a special lake-movement ability, they could move
from any of the surrounding territories onto the lake.
TUNNELS: For the purposes of the Move action for any unit, all
territories with the tunnel icon ( ) are considered to be
adjacent to each other.
RIVER
TUNNEL LAKE
MOVING INTO OPPONENT-CONTROLLED TERRITORIES:
CONTROLLED BY WORKERS
 If your character or mech move into a territory
controlled by an opponent's workers (and no other
units), its movement ends (even if you have a mech
ability that would allow it to move further). Each of
the opponent's workers on that territory immediately
retreats to their faction's home base, leaving behind
any resource tokens. You lose 1 popularity for each of
their workers you forced to retreatthey're not happy
with you for forcing them off their land (in the case
that you cannot reduce your popularity any further,
the workers are still forced to retreat).
 Your workers cannot move by themselves into
territories controlled by opponent workers.

CONTROLLED BY A STRUCTURE:
 Any unit can move into a territory controlled only by
a structure. The player who controls the unit now also
controls the territory.

CONTROLLED BY CHARACTER AND/OR MECHS:
 If your character or mech move into a territory
controlled by an opponent's character and/or mechs,
its movement ends (even if you have a mech ability
that would allow it to move further). The opponent
still temporarily controls that territory. After you've
completed all Move actions, if any of your mechs or
your character share a territory with an opponent's
character or mechs, combat happens (see Combat
section, pages 22-23).
 Your workers cannot move by themselves into or out
of territories controlled by opponent characters and/
or mechs.
HOME BASE: By default, you may not use the Move action
to move any unit from the board into any home base
(including yours).
ENCOUNTERS: If you move your character into a territory
with an encounter token, their movement ends and they
cannot move again this turn. After resolving all combats
for this turn, if your character is still in such a territory,
discard the encounter token and resolve the encounter (see
Encounters, page 24).
NO LIMIT: There is no limit to the number of same-faction
units that can be on a territory.
STRATEGY TIP: While producing with workers will provide the bulk of most players' resources, trading has some
benefits over producing that should not be underestimated. For example, trading for a desired resource
is sometimes preferable to moving a worker to a territory that provides that resource. The action that you
would have spent on movement can now be used for something more productive. Trading also allows players
to access resources that aren't available in their homeland.

BOLSTER:
Pay the cost ($1) and gain one of the following:
POWER: Increase your power by 2 on the Power Track. Power is the commodity you will spend
in combat.
COMBAT CARD(S): Draw 1 combat card. Combat cards are used to augment the power you spend
in combat (you may spend up to 1 combat card per character/mech in combat). If a combat
card would need to be drawn from an empty deck, first shuffle the discard pile to create a
new deck. If there is no discard pile, no cards are drawn.
TRADE
Pay the cost ($1) and gain one of the following:
RESOURCES: Gain any 2 resource tokens (any combination of oil, metal, food, and/or wood)
and place them on any territory you control with at least one worker on it. You may not take
the trade action to pay for resources if all of your workers are on your home base.
POPULARITY: Increase your popularity by 1 on the Popularity Track. Popularity is a commodity
used in Encounters, and it determines your scoring multiplier at the end of the game.

PRODUCE:
Pay the cost (depending on what is shown on all exposed red rectangles before taking the
Produce action), choose up to 2 different territories you control, and all workers on those
territories may produce.
On the territories you selected for production, each worker may produce 1 token. The
resource token is placed on the territory where it was produced. If a worker produces
another worker (by producing on a village), after paying the Produce cost, pick up the
leftmost worker of the Produce action on your Player Mat and place it on the village.
It is possiblealbeit very rarethat players may find themselves in a position where they cannot take any actions (if they
last took a Move action and have no coins, resources, power, or popularity). If that happens, the player must take a "dead
turn" where they choose another section of the Player Mat without taking any of the actions there. We recommend being
thrifty with coins early in the game to prevent this from happening.
EXAMPLE: If you
choose to produce
on two territories
(a farm with 1
worker and a
mountain with
2 workers), you
would produce 1
food on the farm
and 1 or 2 metal
on the mountain.
TERRAIN TYPE WHAT IT PRODUCES
MOUNTAIN METAL
TUNDRA OIL
FARM FOOD
FOREST WOOD
LAKE
VILLAGE WORKER
FACTORY
PAYMENT IS REQUIRED: As is the case with any action, you must be able to pay the full cost to take
the Produce action. If you don't have the coins, popularity, and/or power, you must take
other actions instead.
NO LIMIT: Any number of resource tokens or workers can be on a territory. There are no
limits to the number of resource tokens in the game. If necessary, place a multiplier token
next to resource tokens on the board.
WORKERS ARE PERMANENT: Once you have a worker on the board, you cannot return it to your
Player Mat.
The bottom-row actions are in the same order on all Player Mats, but the costs and benefits vary. The Player Mat visuals and
the default costs and benefits explained in this section are based on the starting position of each Player Mat.
OVERLAPPING TURNS: Usually when a player starts to take the
bottom-row action (which isn't interactive but may take a few
seconds to figure out), the next player can start to take their
turn.
COINS: Most of the bottom actions give you at least one coin
when you pay to take that action. We recommend that players
take the coins before implementing the main focus of the
action so they don't forget to gain those coins. A player may
choose not to take the coins (e.g., if coins interfere with their
objective).
COMPLETING ACTIONS: Eventually you may "complete" a bottomrow
action (e.g., with the Upgrade action, at some point you
may have nothing more to upgrade). After that point you may
continue to pay the cost of the action to gain the coins (and
the recruit bonus, if applicable).
RECRUITS: Each of the bottom actions has a Recruit Ongoing
Bonus (green circle). If it is exposed, it rewards a player when
they or adjacent opponents take this action. See the Enlist
section for details (page 20).
BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS
UPGRADE
Upgrading improves the efficiency of the infrastructure in
your growing empire. The resource used to upgrade is oil.
To upgrade, pay the cost, pick up a technology cube from
any green box on your Player Mat, and place it on any empty
red box with bracketed borders. Red boxes with solid black
borders are off limits for upgrades.
EXAMPLE: You decide that you want to be able to
Produce on 3 territories instead of 2 (ignore the Mill
for this example), and you want to decrease the cost
of enlisting a recruit by 1 food. By taking the Upgrade
action, in addition to paying the oil cost and gaining
the coin benefit, pick up any technology cube from a
green box (in this case, the Produce action benefit)
and move it to any red box with bracketed borders
(in this case, the Enlist action cost).

DEPLOY:
You can deploy mechs (miniatures) to protect your workers,
expand your empire, and add new abilities to your character
and other mechs. The resource used to deploy mechs is metal.
To deploy a mech, pay the cost, choose any mech on your
Faction Mat, and place that mech on a territory you control
with at least one worker on it. You can't deploy mechs on lakes
(even if your faction has mech abilities allowing your mechs to
move onto lakes).
From now on, your character and all mechs (not your workers)
gain the ability on the Faction Mat that was under the mech
miniature. These abilities vary from faction to faction.
SPEED: Your character and mechs may move one additional
territory when moving. If any of those units move into a
territory containing an opponent's character, mech, or
worker, their movement ends and they cannot move again
this turn. Moving from one tunnel to another still counts
as 1 move, so with this ability you could move an additional
territory before or after moving through a tunnel. Your
mechs can pick up and drop off resources and workers
in the middle of a Move action when they have the Speed
ability.
SAXONY
RIVERWALK: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto forests and mountains.
UNDERPASS: For the purposes of Move actions for your
character and mechs, mountains you control and all
tunnels are considered to be adjacent to each other. For
example, if your mech is on a mountain, it can move from
that mountain to (a) any other mountain you control or (b)
any tunnel (or your Mine).
DISARM: Before you engage in combat on a territory with
a tunnel or your Mine, the combating opponent loses 2
power. This loss of power is reflected on the Power Track.
You may do this once per combat, not once per unit.
RIVERWALK: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto forests and mountains.
SEAWORTHY: Your character and mechs can move to and from
lakes and retreat onto adjacent lakes (you may still also
retreat those units to your home base). This allows for
lake hexes to be treated the same as other territories for
movement. If a mech transports workers onto a lake (during
a Move action or when retreating) or if a character or mech
transports resources onto a lake, you may not leave those
workers or resources on the lake after moving off of it, nor
may a worker move off of the lake without the assistance of
the mech. Lakes are territories, so if two factions have a lakemovement
ability, it's possible for combat to happen on a
lake. You cannot build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake.
ARTILLERY: Before you engage in combat, you may pay 1 power
to force the combating opponent to lose 2 power. This loss
of power is reflected on the Power Track. You may do this
once per combat, not once per unit.
SPEED: Your character and mechs may move one additional
territory per movement. See page 15 for full details.
NORDIC
PEOPLE'S ARMY: In combat where you have at least 1 worker,
you may play one additional combat card. You still require
a character or mech to participate in combat. For example,
if you have 2 mechs and 3 workers in combat, you may play
up to 3 combat cards (1 for each of the mechs and 1 because
you have at least 1 worker).
SPEED: Your character and mechs may move one additional
territory per movement. See page 15 for full details.
RUSVIET
RIVERWALK: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto farms and villages.
TOWNSHIP: For the purposes of Move actions for your
character and mechs, villages you control and the Factory
are considered to be adjacent to each other. For example,
if your mech is on a village, it can move from that village to
(a) any other village you control or (b) the Factory.
BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS continued
RIVERWALK: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto farms and tundra.
WAYFARE: Your character and mechs may move from a
territory or home base to any inactive faction's home
base or your own regardless of the distance. An "inactive
faction" is any faction not currently in the game, including
the expansion factions. Normally players may not move
into any home base, but this is an exception to that rule.
SCOUT: Before you engage in combat, steal one of the
opponent's combat cards at random and add it to your
hand. You may do this once per combat, not once per unit.
SPEED: Your character and mechs may move one additional
territory per movement. See page 15 for full details.
RIVERWALK: Your character and mechs can move across rivers
onto villages and mountains.
SUBMERGE: Your character and mechs may move to and from lakes
and move from any lake to another (similar to tunnel movement,
but with lakes). If a mech transports workers onto a lake or if a
character or mech transports resources onto a lake, you may not
leave those workers or resources on the lake after moving off of
it, nor may a worker move off of the lake without the assistance of
the mech. Lakes are territories, so if two factions have a lakemovement
ability, it's possible for combat to happen on a lake.
You cannot build a structure or deploy a mech on a lake.
CRIMEA
POLANIA
CAMARADERIE: You do not lose popularity when forcing an
opponent's workers to retreat after winning combat as the
aggressor. This applies any time on your turn when your
character or mechs force an opponent's workers to retreat
after combat.
SPEED: Your character and mechs may move one additional
territory per movement. See page 15 for full details.

BUILD:
You can build structures (structure tokens) to enhance your actions, control territories,
and get end-game bonuses. The resource used to build structures is wood.
To build a structure, pay the cost, pick up any structure from your Player Mat, and place it
on a territory you control with at least one worker on it.
LIMIT 1 PER TERRITORY: Only 1 structure can be built on each territory. So if you're the first
player to build a structure on a specific territory, neither you nor any opponent may
build another structure there.
STRUCTURE CONTROL: Opponents can't use your structure abilities. You always get the abilities
from your structures even if you don't control the territories they're on (except for the
Mill--you can't Produce on the Mill's territory if you don't control that territory).
TERRITORY CONTROL: A territory with one of your structures on it is under your control even
if you have no units there. However, if an opponent's unit is on a territory with your
structure, that territory is under their control.
PERMANENCE: Structures cannot be destroyed or moved.
FACTORY: You may build on the Factory territory.
PLACES YOU CAN'T BUILD: Your home base isn't a territory, so you can't build there. You also
can't build structures on lakes.
ONGOING BONUS: The benefit revealed by removing a structure from your Player Mat is an
additional benefit you will gain when taking the top-row action directly above it in the
future.
ARMORY: Whenever you take
the Trade action, also gain
1 power.
MONUMENT: Whenever you take
the Bolster action, also gain 1
popularity.
MILL: Whenever you take
the Produce action, the
territory with the Mill may
count as an extra (bonus)
territory for production.
The Mill will produce as if
it were a worker. If there
are actual workers on the
Mill territory, they may also
produce resources.
MINE: The Mine acts as a
tunnel that only you can use.
You may move units to and
from your Mine as if it is a
tunnel (even if an opponent
controls the territory the
Mine is on). Unlike the other
structures, this is an ongoing
ability associated with all
unit movement.
END-GAME BONUS: At the end of the game, players will gain coins for achieving the
goals shown on the structure bonus tile that was randomly selected during
setup. You gain this bonus even if you don't control the territories the structures
are on. This bonus represents how property values have strengthened your
expanding empire.
The 6 structure bonus tiles are as follows:
Number of lakes adjacent to
your structures. Only count
each lake once.
Number of tunnel
territories adjacent to your
structures. Only count each
tunnel once. A Mine does
not count as a tunnel for
this purpose, and rivers do
not break adjacency.
Number of encounters
adjacent to your structures.
Only count each encounter
once. These count whether
or not the encounter tokens
are still there. Rivers do not
break adjacency.
Number of tunnel
territories with your
structures on them. A Mine
does not count as a tunnel
for this purpose.
Number of your structures
in a row (any continuous
straight line is fine; only
count the longest row of
structures you have; rivers
do not break continuity).
Number of farms and
tundras with your structures
on them.
EXAMPLE: The structure
bonus for this game
is for the number of
lakes adjacent to your
structures. If you had
the two structures
positioned as shown
here, you would gain
coins for 4 lakes (a
total of $6). You gain
those coins even if
you do not control
the territories your
structures are on.

ONE-TIME BONUS: To enlist a recruit, pay the cost, pick up a
recruit token from any section of your Player Mat, place
it on any open Recruit One-Time Bonus space on your
Faction Mat, and immediately gain the depicted bonus.
This represents what your new recruit is immediately
contributing to your forces. The token remains there
permanentlyit can't be moved.
The four one-time bonuses are:
Gain 2 power
Gain 2 coins
Gain 2 popularity
Draw 2 combat cards

ENLIST:
You can enlist new recruits (cylindrical tokens) to join your
forces. The resource used to enlist recruits is food.
ONGOING BONUS: In addition to the one-time bonus, each
recruit gives you a Recruit Ongoing Bonus related to the
action from which you selected the recruit token (the bonus
in the circle). This represents a skill the recruit brings to
your force.
For the rest of the game, whenever you or the player to your
immediate left or right (these players are shown in the icon
in the red circle) take the bottom-row action in the section
of the Player Mat from which the recruit was taken, you
may gain the specified bonus. Top-row actions or a similar
action on a Factory card (see Factory section, page 25) do
not count.

PLAYER ORDER: If more than one player would gain a Recruit
Ongoing Bonus, the active player goes first, followed by
the player to their left, then the player on their right. If
one of those players places their 6th star as a result, the
game immediately ends (see Game End and Scoring,
page 28).

PROCLAMATION: You must announce when you take bottomrow
actions so adjacent players know to check for
Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.

TWO-PLAYER RULES: In a 2-player game,whenever your
opponent takes an action that would give you a Recruit
Ongoing Bonus, you only gain it once.
EXAMPLE: Whenever the blue (Nordic)
player OR the player to the left or
right of the Nordic player takes
the Build action, the Nordic player
gains 1 popularity, which is in the
green circle.
Each faction has a special ability indicated at the upper right of the Faction Mat.
RUSVIET (RELENTLESS): You may choose the same section on your Player Mat as the
previous turn(s).
The Rusviets push their people hard, day after day, to achieve their ultimate goal. While
other factions let their infrastructure take a break from turn to turn, the Rusviet faction
may choose the same section of their Player Mat as the previous turn(s). This ability
also applies to a Factory card if you have one (see Factory section).
CRIMEA (COERCION): Once per turn, you may spend 1 combat card as if it were any
1 resource token.
The Crimean faction has a longstanding tradition of selling information to the highest
bidder. They may spend 1 combat card per turn as if it were a resource to pay for
something (1 combat card = any 1 resource token, regardless of the number on the
combat card). Combat cards are still worth nothing at the end of the game.
NORDIC (SWIM): Your workers may move across rivers.
Nordic workers are accomplished swimmers who refuse to complain even when wading
through the coldest of waters. They may move across rivers onto any type of terrain
(except lakes). This ability applies only to workers, not the character and mechs.
POLANIA (MEANDER): Pick up to 2 options per encounter card.
Thanks to Anna's charismatic bear companion, Wojtek, the pair tend to stretch short
encounters into longer adventures. Instead of picking just 1 option per encounter card,
the Polanian faction may choose up to 2 different options per encounter card in any
order. The benefit from the first selected option may be used to pay the cost for the
second selected option. Only one encounter card is drawn.
SAXONY (DOMINATE): There is no limit to the number of stars you can place from completing
objectives or winning combat.
Saxony's methodical approach to conquering the eastern lands surrounding the
Factory is all about asserting force and completing specific missions. The Saxon faction
may complete both of their objective cards (they don't discard the second card after
achieving the first), and they are not limited to 2 combat victory stars. If Saxony has
available stars, after winning combat, they must place the star.
FACTION ABILITIES
DESIGNER'S NOTE: One of the subtle benefits of some of these faction abilities is that they
help to teach and remind players of the global rules of Scythe...by breaking those rules.
For example, when you read that the Rusviet faction can choose the same section of their
Player Mat on subsequent turns, you also learn that under normal circumstances, you
can't choose the same section twice in a row. In a game with lots of rules to remember, I
found that these subtle reminders really help.
Combat may happen at the end of a player's Move action (after all units have moved but
before the player takes a bottom-row action). If that player's character and/or mechs share
a territory with an opponent's character and/or mechs, combat occurs. It's possible for
this to happen on multiple territories; in that case, the active player (the attacker) chooses
the order in which these combats occur.
Combat happens only between the two players whose units share a territory, either of
whom can gain a star for winning the combat. Other players may try to influence the
combating players by bribing them with coins (see
Alliances and Bribes, page 26).
NO REQUIREMENTS: You may initiate combat even if you have 0
power and/or 0 popularity.
ATTACKER ADVANTAGE: If the attacking player has a mech ability
that impacts combat, they use that ability first, followed by
the defending player. Also, if combat results in a tie, the
attacking player wins.
SELECT POWER
Simultaneously and secretly select a number on your Power
Dial (align the number with the icon at the top right).
That is the amount of power you will spend, so you cannot
choose a number higher than the amount of power you
currently have on the Power Track. The track goes up to 16
but you can only spend up to 7 power on your Power Dial.
ADD COMBAT CARD(S) (OPTIONAL): By default, for each of your units
involved in the current combat (character and/or mechs),
you may tuck 1 combat card from your hand behind the
Power Dial. You may do this even if you select 0 power on
your Power Dial.
The number of combat cards you have in hand is public
information, but during combat you may conceal whether
or not you've used any of those cards. The combat deck
contains the following cards:
COMBAT
DESIGNER'S NOTE: You might be surprised by how few combats happen in
a game of Scythe, especially given the universal presence of mechs in
Jakub's art. However, if you look at all of the illustrations, you'll notice
that very few of the mechs are actually fighting. In that way, Scythe is
just as much about the threat of combat as it is actual combat. If your
neighbor has built up a big pool of power and combat cards, you're less
likely to attack them. Similarly, you might position workers on key
territories to dissuade more aggressive players from attacking you there
due to the loss of popularity if they win. It is this tension that exemplifies
the core theme of Scythe: the intersection of farming and war.
POWER DIAL ASSEMBLY
Assemble your
power dial by
placing the
enclosed plastic
rivets through the
punched out holes.

REVEAL:
Both players reveal their Power Dials and selected combat cards simultaneously. The value provided by any combat cards
provides an additional bonus to the power you spend from the Power Track as indicated on your Power Dial.
The player with the highest total power wins the combat (ties go to the attacking player). Both players then pay the amount
of power they selected on their Power Dials, and they discard any combat cards they used face-up (you don't adjust the
Power Track for combat cardsthey're just a temporary boost).
WINNER: The winner gains (or maintains) control of the
territory and all resource tokens on it. The winner also
places 1 star token in the combat space of the Triumph
Track (see Placing Stars, page 27) if they haven't already
placed 2 stars for combat victories. If the winner was the
attacker, they lose 1 popularity for each worker they forced
to retreat by initiating and winning combat. Also, if there
was an encounter token on the territory and the winner has
a character there, they now perform the encounter.
LOSER: The loser must retreat all of their unitsmechs,
characters, and workersfrom the combat territory to
their home base (pick up those units and put them down on
their home base). All resources those units were carrying
remain on the territory and are now under the control of
the winner. If the loser revealed at least 1 power on the
dial or through combat cards, they gain 1 combat card as
they retreat.
LIMITED STARS AND GAME END: Each player can gain a maximum
of 2 stars for winning combat (with the exception of the
Saxon player, who can gain unlimited combat victory stars),
but they may still engage in future combats after they've
achieved those 2 stars. If your 6th star is placed but you still
have a combat remaining on your turn, the game ends and
any units you moved to initiate that combat will move back
to the territory from whence they came.
BATTLE IN A LAKE: Lake battles can happen between factions
like Polania and Nordic that have activated lake-related
mech abilities. If a mech transporting workers is attacked
while on a lake and the attacker wins combat, the attacking
player loses 1 popularity for each of those workers (they are
forced to retreat with the mech to their home base).
EXAMPLE: John takes a Move action, first moving
his character onto an unoccupied farm, then
moving a mech carrying 2 workers onto a
territory controlled by Sandra. Sandra has her
character, a mech, a worker, and 3 food tokens
on that territory.
John has 10 power and Sandra has 4 (this is
shown on the Power Track on the board). John
turns his dial to select 7 power. He has one
combat unit (the mech), so he can add 1 combat
card from his hand, but he chooses not to do so.
Sandra decides to spend 4 power on her Power
Dial. She has both her character and a mech on
the territory, so she can spend up to 2 combat
cards if she wants to. She chooses to just play a
3-power card and tucks it behind her Power Dial.
When they've both finalized their decisions, they
reveal their Power Dials at the same time. Sandra
groansshe tied John's total power (7 to 7), but
attackers win ties!
So John takes over the territory and the 3 food,
and Sandra's units retreat back to her home
base. John loses 1 popularity because, as the
attacker, he forced 1 worker to retreat. John also
places a combat victory star on the board.
Sandra's only compensation is that she gets to
draw a combat card since she revealed at least 1
power on the dial or through combat cards.
STRATEGY TIP: Just because an opponent has a lot more power than you doesn't necessarily mean they'll
win in combat against you. They don't know how much power you will spend or the amount of power
your combat cards will add (combat cards aren't worth anything at the end of the game, so spend them
early and often). The puzzle of combat is outwitting your opponent, especially when they think they're
going to win.
As your character treks across Eastern Europa, they
will encounter a number of local people and situations.
Each encounter will present you with three options to
determine how you want to interact with the people. The
choice you make will often impact the peoples' view of you,
represented in the game by your popularity.
When you move your character onto a territory with an
encounter token on it ( ), their movement ends and
they cannot move again this turn. When your Move action
is completely over and you've resolved all combats (but
before you take a bottom-row action, if applicable), discard
the encounter token and draw an encounter card. Only
characters will trigger an encounter.

ENCOUNTERS:
Show the art to the other players and read the thematic text (the text in all caps) out
loud. Then read through the various costs and benefits on the options and choose one (you
must choose one and pay the cost if applicable, though you may gain as much of the benefit
as you'd like). After you make your selection, discard the encounter card to the bottom of
the encounter deck face-down.
REQUIRED COST AND OPTIONAL BENEFIT: If you don't have popularity or coins to pay for certain
options, those options aren't available. You may gain as much of the benefit as you like
(e.g., if a benefit would give you 2 metal and 1 worker but you don't want the worker, you
can just gain the 2 metal).
BENEFIT LOCATION: Any resources, structures, mechs, or workers you gain from the encounter
card go on the same territory as your character (i.e., where the encounter took place).
ISOLATED COST AND BENEFIT: If an encounter card instructs you to gain something or perform an
action, you do not pay any additional costs or gain additional benefits beyond those on the
encounter card, nor do you trigger any Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
COMBAT: If a character moves onto a territory with an encounter token and an opponent's
mech, thus initiating combat, the encounter only happens after the character wins combat.
Otherwise the encounter token remains on the territory.
NUMBER: The number in the upper left corner is just for referencing the card for questions
posted on places like BoardGameGeek.com or stonemaiergames.com.
DESIGNER'S NOTE: We made a specific design decision with the beautifully illustrated
encounter cards: Rather than tell the players what they're seeing through a label or
flavor text, we'll let you use your eyes to see the scene you've stumbled upon. There's
often a lot happening in these scenes (it's usually not just one specific thing that's
happening), and the three options explain the various ways in which you can act.
Encounter cards are shown to all players when they're drawn, so your gaming group
can integrate as much or as little of the story into the way they play Scythe as they like.
We're giving you the same visual freedom you'd experience if you stumbled upon these
scenes in real life rather than restricting you to the limitations of flavor textafter all, a
picture is worth a thousand words.
The Factory is the centerpiece of the Scythe board. It is a place of technological innovation
and untapped power. Unlike most other territories, the Factory does not produce any
resources. At the end of the game, the Factory is worth a total of 3 territories (instead of
just 1) to the player who controls it.
When your Move action is completely finished (after winning combat if necessary), if your
character is on the Factory for the first time this game, look through the Factory cards on
the board. You must choose one card and return the rest to the board.
The first player to look at those cards will see cards equal to the number of players +1; each
subsequent player to visit the Factory with their character will see one fewer card. It's good
to get there first.

FACTORY CARDS:
Each Factory card is the equivalent of a fifth section of your Player Mat (place it next to
your Player Mat).
USING FACTORY ACTIONS: The Factory card is treated as any other section on your Player Mat. On
your turn, you may place your action token on the Factory card and take one or both actions
(starting with the top-row action if you choose to take both).
SEPARATE FROM PLAYER MAT BONUSES: Even if the Factory card action does something similar to
another action on your Player Mat, they're completely independent of one another. So you
get neither Recruit Ongoing Bonuses, Structure bonuses, nor coins from similar actions
on your Player Mat.
MOVE: All Factory cards have a bottom-row Move action. It's a little different than a standard
Move action, as it says, "Move one unit up to two times within the same Move action."
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER RULES: All other rules for movement still apply, especially those
that say that the entire Move action ends if your character moves onto a territory
with an encounter token or a character/mech moves onto a territory occupied by an
opponent's unit(s).
MINE: If you have a Mine, you may move through the Mine with this Move action.
SPEED: If you've unlocked the Speed mech ability, one of your mechs or your character
may move up to 3 territories with this Move action.
ONE-CARD LIMIT: You may have at most one Factory card (the one you choose the first time your
character goes to the Factory).
PERMANENT SELECTION: Your selection is permanentyou may not switch your Factory card for
another card if your character ends a future Move action on the Factory.

THE FACTORY:
STRATEGY TIP: Don't underestimate the power of being able to move every turn. Without a
Factory card, you can only move once every other turn, but once you get that card, you
become much more nimble and responsive than players without that capability.
EXAMPLE: This Factory
card allows you to
pay 1 popularity to
Enlist a recruit OR
perform an Upgrade
(or skip the top-row
action). Then you
may Move any one
unit up to two times.
Each player starts the game with 2 objective cards that are kept secret from
the other players. You may reveal a completed objective card during your own
turn before or after you complete a top- or bottom-row action. If you do,
place 1 star token on the objective space of the Triumph Track and discard
the card along with your other objective to the bottom of the objective deck.
You can only achieve 1 objective star, unless you're the Saxon player, who can
achieve up to 2 objective stars.
You may wait to reveal your completed objective if you wish, but you must
meet the entire objective requirements at the time you reveal it.

OBJECTIVES:

ALLIANCES AND BRIBES:
DESIGNER'S NOTE: It may seem a little odd that each player has 2 objective cards but
may only complete one of them. There are a few reasons for this. The first is that the
alternative would be to have each player draw 2 cards at the beginning of the game and
keep 1. However, I prefer not to ask players to make decisions before the game begins,
as it makes the game more welcoming to new players and gives experienced players
more freedom depending on how the game starts to play out. The second is that it
gives players the flexibility to change strategies mid-game. Maybe you were pursuing
one strategy, but that strategy didn't end up working out. No problemyou still have
another objective card to use.
Players may make informal agreements (e.g., "I won't attack you this turn if you don't
attack me next turn"). The only tangible items that may be exchanged are coins. In
tournament play, coins may not be exchanged for deals or alliances.
You can't negotiate your way out of a combat that has already begunthat is, if a player
moves their character and/or mechs onto a territory you control with your character and/
or mechs, at the end of their Move action, the two of you must engage in combat (you can't
pay them off at that point, though you could try to influence the outcome). Agreements
made between players are not enforceable.
When you reach a pinnacle of empire building, your faction rewards you with a star. Stars
are worth coins at the end of the game.
Here are the ways to place stars, as shown on the Triumph Track:
Complete all 6 upgrades
Deploy all 4 mechs
Build all 4 structures
Enlist all 4 recruits
Have all 8 workers on the
board
Reveal 1 completed
objective card
Win combat (up to 2 times)
Have 18 popularity
Have 16 power
When you achieve one of these goals, you must place a star on the appropriate space on the
Triumph Track. You cannot lose a star after you've placed it. For example, if you place a
star for reaching 18 popularity and you later drop below 18, the star remains on the track.
By default, each player may complete each of these goals exactly one time. Having a star on
a goal does not prevent other players from placing their stars on the same goal.
PL ACING STARS
STRATEGY TIP: You can't place more than 6 stars, so it's
generally better to focus on completing 6 specific goals
than trying to do a little of everything.
EXAMPLE: If you have 10 popularity, you will earn
$4 for every star you placed, $3 for each territory
you control, and $2 for every 2 resource tokens
you control. If you have 18 popularity, you score
within the 13-17 popularity level.
The game immediately ends when a player places their 6th star token, even if they have other things they could do that
turn or other things would happen afterwards.

VARIANT:

DELAY OF GAME: Because of the various end-game scoring
categories and their connection to popularity, it's
difficult for players to determine who is in the lead (this
is intentional). However, it is possible for a player to
interrupt the game to calculate the final score for each
player as they plan out their next few moves. That's not fun
for anyone. The Delay of Game variant says that if a player
delays the game (while the game is being played, not during
end-game scoring) for more than 10 seconds by trying to
calculate the final score, they lose 2 popularity.
GAME END AND SCORING
DESIGNER'S NOTE: Scythe incentivizes players to end the game
if possible by making stars worth coins and denying
additional turns to opponents. This may result in some
opponents having one fewer overall turns than the player
who placed their final star.
END-GAME SCORING
Accumulate your final fortunecoins you had before
the game end was triggered plus end-game coinsto
determine the winner. You should have a mound of coins
in front of you before announcing the total to the other
players.
To determine how many coins you earn for each of the three
scoring categories, look at your level on the Popularity
Track and pick up coins for that category (do this on your
ownthere is no need for a "banker").

SAMPLE SCORING ROUND:
The first time you play Scythe, we recommend that you run
a sample scoring round during the game so players have a
feel for the actual end-game scoring in advance. After any
player places their first star, pause the game to let players
calculate their current score. This is just for the sake of
examplethis scoring does not actually happen until the
end of the game.

EDGE CASES:
If the 6th star comes from taking a bottom-row action, gain
the primary benefit, the coins, and the Recruit Ongoing
Benefit before placing the star.
If you have units (character, mechs, or workers) remaining
on a territory with an opponent's units (from a Move
action), you must undo that portion of your Move action,
returning the unit(s) to the territory they moved from.
If you place a star for total popularity or total power as
a recruit bonus on an opponent's turn, that placement
happens after the opponent takes the action (e.g., build
a structure) in clockwise order and only if that opponent
didn't place their 6th star by taking that action.

SCORING CATEGORIES:
COINS IN HAND: The coins you accumulated during the game
count for end-game scoring.
EVERY STAR TOKEN PLACED: Gain coins for every star token you
placed during the game.
EVERY TERRITORY CONTROLLED: Gain coins for every territory you
control (including lakes). Home bases aren't territories. You
control each territory where you have a worker, mech, or
character, or where you have a structure (but no enemy units).
FACTORY: At the end of the game, the Factory is counted as
3 territories to the player who controls it.
EVERY 2 RESOURCES CONTROLLED: Gain coins for every 2 resource
tokens you control (e.g., if you control 13 resource tokens
and have 10 popularity, you'll gain a total of 12 coins).
Workers are not resources. You control all resources on
territories where you have a character, worker, mech, or a
structure not occupied by an opponent's unit.
STRUCTURE BONUS TILE: Gain coins based on the number of
structure bonuses you achieved. You gain this bonus even if
you don't control the territories your structures are on.
DECLARING THE WINNER
Announce your coin total, and the player with the most
coins wins! If multiple players have the same total, use the
following as tiebreakers (in order):
1. Number of workers, mechs, and structures
2. Power
3. Popularity
4. Number of resource tokens controlled
5. Number of territories controlled
6. Number of star tokens placed on board
ACHIEVEMENT SHEET: The winner of the game may write
their name up to 2 times on the achievement sheet to
memorialize their victory. This document commemorates
the first time any player wins under a certain condition
(e.g., the first victory with a specific faction).
30
You are represented on the board by your character, who has been sent on a mission to make your faction's claim to the
uncharted lands surrounding the defunct Factory. Each character unit is comprised of a person and their animal companion.
While each of the characters appears to be functionally the same as the others, their unique abilities are manifested in
their respective faction and mech abilities. A full backstory for each character can be found on the Stonemaier Games
website, but here is a short description of each one:
ANNA & WOJTEK (POLANIA REPUBLIC): An expert marksman and a helpful bear, Anna and Wojtek
traveled across the countryside during the Great War, becoming living legends as they
distinguished themselves in battle and showed compassion to even the poorest farmers.
With the Factory shut down and rumors swirling about a growing Rusviet force, Anna
and Wojtek have accepted a mission to ensure the unity and independence of Polania by
securing the eastern border and patrolling the lands surrounding the Factory.
GUNTER VON DUISBURG WITH NACHT & TAG (SAXONY EMPIRE): During the war, Gunter and his wolves
led elite mech squads across the forests and mountains of Saxony and Europa. His name
was both feared and respected, and his jacket grew heavy with medals of honor. Now that
the war is over, the Emperor has asked Gunter to embark on a new adventure to the east,
where he sees a fresh opportunity to expand the Saxony foothold on the unclaimed lands
surrounding the Factory. Tag is shown on several encounter cards, but she is not part of the
character miniature.
ZEHRA & KAR (CRIMEAN KHANATE): The firstborn daughter of the Khan of the Crimean Tartars,
Zehra is able to see through her eagle's eyes, heightening her already formidable skill with
the bow. Though her father was loath to adopt the Factory's advances, he realized that the
world was changing and he could not leave the Khanate exposed to its rivals. Reluctantly, he
has tasked his daughter with an expedition to the north for the purpose of acquiring more
modern technology and ensuring lasting peace for their people.
OLGA ROMANOVA & CHANGA (RUSVIET UNION): When Olga's first love, Viktor, went missing during
the Great War, she vowed to find him again. She joined the Rusviet military intelligence
service with Changa, her Siberian tiger, at her side. With her intelligence and ambition,
she has risen quickly through the ranks, and has used her newly-earned authority to
launch a full-blown invasion into the western landsa desperate attempt to find her
beloved Viktor, with the full strength of the Rusviet military at her back!
BJORN & MOX (NORDIC KINGDOM): Bjorn, the descendant of a renowned Viking family, was saved
from perishing in a blizzard by a kindly muskox. After surviving the ordeal, Bjorn took
the creature as his mount and named him Mox. Together they embarked on a series of
adventures across the land, serving as ambassadors to other tribes, executing military
operations, and seeking out new oil reserves. The King has now sent them southward to
add new villages and farms to the kingdom, either by diplomacy or by force, as well as to
explore the Factory with the hope of gaining a technological advantage for future wars.

CHARACTERS:

RESOURCES: All unitscharacters, mechs, & workers can carry
around resources (any number).
TURNS AND PLAYER MATS: On your turn, you must choose a different
section of your Player Mat than you did the previous turn.
Take either the top-row action, the bottom-row action, or
both (starting with the top action). First pay the full cost of the
action (all icons on exposed red boxes), then gain the benefit
(exposed green boxes). If you select a bottom-row action,
the player to your left may start to take their turn while you
decide exactly which upgrade, mech, structure, or recruit you
will gain. Remember to take the coins from the bottom-row
actions!
MOVE ACTION: You must move different units (not the same unit
multiple times). You may choose only to use part of the
Move action if you only want to move one unit. A mech can
transport workers as part of its movement, then one of those
workers could also move.
PRODUCE ACTION: Produce on 2 different territories. Each worker
on those territories may produce 1 resource token. So if you
have 3 workers on a forest and 2 workers on a farm, a Produce
action generates 3 wood on the forest and 2 food on the farm.
WORKERS: Workers are not resources, but they are produced on
villages just like resources are produced on other terrains.
Just as with any Produce action, first pay the full cost on all
exposed red boxes on the Produce action, then Produce the
worker(s) by taking the meeple from your Player Mat (left
to right). You may choose not to produce a worker, as it can
increase the cost of future Produce actions. Once produced,
workers may never return to your Player Mat.
TRADE: When taking the Trade action, choose any 2 resource
tokens (either the same or different types) and place them on
a territory you control that contains a worker.
BOLSTER: Gain power on the Power Track or draw combat card(s).
If the combat card deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to
form a new deck.
BOTTOM-ROW ACTIONS: You may continue to pay to take a bottom-row
action for the coin(s) even after you've achieved a star for the
action. This will continue to trigger Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
UPGRADE: Pick up a technology cube from any green box on your
Player Mat and place it on any red bracketed box on your
Player Mat.
MECHS: Only mechs may carry around workers (any number of
workers)not characters. Mech abilities apply to all mechs
and your character. Each faction has a slightly different
Riverwalk mech ability. If a mech has the Speed ability, it may
pick up and drop off workers/resources mid-movement.
RIVERWALK: Each faction has a slightly different version of the
Riverwalk ability, allowing them to move across rivers onto
two specific terrain types.
STRUCTURES: Only a single structure may be present on each
territory. Structures can't be built on lakes.
RECRUITS: Gain a One-Time Recruit Bonus when taking the
Enlist action. From then on, gain a Recruit Ongoing Bonus
whenever you or the player to your left or right take the
bottom-row action corresponding to that bonus.
COMBAT: Only characters and mechs participate in combat
(moving a character or mech onto a territory containing
an opponent's worker is not combat). Ties are won by the
attacker. If the loser of combat revealed any power during the
combat (either on the Power Dial or via combat cards), they
gain a combat card. Both the winner and loser must pay the
power they selected on the Power Dial.
RETREATING WORKERS (FORCED): You only lose popularity for forcing an
opponent's worker to retreat on your turn. That is, if you
are attacked by a mech with workers on it and you win the
combat, you do not lose 1 popularity for forcing each of those
workers to retreat. On your turn, you may force opponent
workers to retreat even if you don't have enough popularity.
ENCOUNTERS: Only characters may have encounters. To choose
an option on the encounter card, you must be able to pay the
cost (if any). All resources, units, or structures gained from
an encounter card go on the territory where the encounter
occurred. Benefits gained from encounters do not trigger
Recruit Ongoing Bonuses.
FACTORY: Only characters may claim Factory cards (1 per player).
Actions taken on Factory cards do not trigger Recruit Ongoing
Bonuses or Structure Bonuses.
OBJECTIVES: You may reveal a completed objective on your turn.
Discard the other objective card (unless you're playing
Saxony).
STAR PLACEMENT: Once a player places a star on the Triumph Track,
it cannot be removed. Having a star on a goal does not prevent
other players from placing their stars on the same goal. If
a player places their 6th star, the game immediately ends.
Nothing else happens other than end-game scoring.
END-GAME SCORING: At the end of the game, remember to include
coins you earned during the game as part of your final coin
total. When scoring for territorial control, you control a
territory and all resources on it if you have a unit there or if
you have a structure there (unless an opponent has units on
that structure's territory). Make sure to only score for every
two resource tokens you control, not every resource token.

GAME NAME:
SETTLERS OF CATAN

These 4-page rules (pages 2-5) contain all the important
information that you need to play!
If you need more information during the game, you can look
up keywords (marked?) in the "Almanac," which follows
these rules.

GAME COMPONENTS:
- 19 terrain hexes (tiles)
- 6 sea frame pieces
- 9 harbor piece
- 18 circular number tokens (chits)
-  95 Resource Cards (bearing the symbols for the ore, grain, lumber, wool, and brick resources)
- 25 Development Cards (14 Knight/Soldier Cards,
- 6 Progress Cards, 5 Victory Point Cards)
- 4 "Building Costs" Cards
- 2 Special Cards: "Longest Road" & "Largest Army"
- 16 cities (4 of each color shaped like churches)
- 20 settlements (5 of each color shaped like houses)
- 60 roads (15 of each color shaped like bars)
- 2 dice (1 yellow, 1 red)
- 1 robber
- 1 Game Rules & Almanac booklet

CONSTRUCTING THE ISLAND:
The frame pieces hold the board together and prevent the
pieces from moving after the board is in place. Before building
the island, assemble the frame by matching the numbers at the
ends of the frame pieces together (i.e., 1-1, 2-2, etc.).
You can then construct the island of Catan using the
19 terrain hexes as shown on page 3.

STARTING SET-UP FOR BEGINNERS:
You play the game The Settlers of Catan on a variable game
board. For your first game, however, we suggest that you use
the "Starting Set-up for Beginners?." (See Illus. A on page 3.)
This set-up is well-balanced for all players.
Before your first game you must remove the die-cut
components from the cardboard holders. Carefully punch
out and separate the pieces.
Lay out the map as specified in Illustration A (or on
the back of this booklet).
First, assemble the frame as shown.
Second, create Catan by placing the 19 terrain
hexes on the tableagain as shown.
Third, place the circular number tokens
on top of the designated terrain hexes.
Finally, place your settlements
and roads.

Dear Settlers,
Before you invite your fellow gamers over, we suggest that you read over these "Game Rules." Peruse the short Game
Overview on page 16 (the back cover) and study the game board illustration. Then read the Game Rules in peace.
This will not take long. The actual rules (red pages) are quite short.
You do not need to read the Almanac at the back of this book (gold pages) quite yet. Use the Almanac for reference
when questions come up during play.
Now you are ready for your first adventure on Catan. Have fun settling this new land together!

STARTING SET-UP FOR EXPERIENCED PLAYERS:
It is more fun to play with a variable game boardwith the
game board laid out randomly. The board changes each game.
If you would like to use the variable set-up, you can find the
guidelines in the Almanac under Set-up, Variable?. Also look
for useful tips under Set-up Phase? and Tactics?.

SETTING UP THE GAME:
Select a color and take your 5 settlements, 4 cities and
15 roads (no more and no less!). Place your 2 roads and
your 2 settlements on the game board. Place your remaining
settlements, roads, and cities down in front of you.
Note: Remove the red pieces from the game if you are playing a
3-player game.
Take your color's Building Costs Card. (See Illustration B.)
Place the Special Cards "Longest Road" and "Largest Army"
beside the game board along with the 2 dice.
Sort the Resource Cards into 5 stacks and put them face up
next to the game board. Shuffle the Development Cards and
place them face down
by the board.
You receive
resources for each
terrain hex around
your starting
settlement marked
with a white star ?
(see Illustration A).
Take the appropriate
Resource Cards from
their stacks.
Example: See Illustration A. Blue receives 1 brick card, 1 wool card,
and 1 ore card for his leftmost settlement (i.e., his settlement marked
with a star).
Each player keeps his Resource Cards hidden in his hand.
Important: Settlements and cities
may only be placed at the corners
of the terrain hexesnever along
the edges (see Illustration C).
Roads may only be placed at the
edges of the terrain hexes1 road
per edge (see Illustration D). The
Distance Rule means many intersections along roads will remain
unoccupied.

TURN OVERVIEW:
Unless you're using the Starting
Set-Up for Experienced Players,
the oldest player goes first. On
your turn, you can do the following in the order listed:
 You must roll for resource
production? (the result applies to all players).
 You may trade? resources with other players or using
maritime trade.
 You may build? roads?, settlements? or cities? and/or
buy Development Cards?. You may also play one
Development Card? at any time during your turn.
After you're done, pass the dice to the player to your left,
who then continues the game with step 1.
Tip: For advanced players, we recommend combining the second and
third steps. You can find more details in the Almanac under
"Combined Trade/Build Phase."

THE TURN IN DETAIL:
1. Resource Production
You begin your turn by rolling both dice.
The sum of the dice determines which
terrain hexes produce resources.
Each player who has a settlement on an intersection? that
borders a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives
1 Resource Card of the hex's type. For an example see
resource production?. If you have 2 or 3 settlements
bordering that hex, you receive 1 Resource Card for each
settlement. You receive 2 Resource Cards for each city you
own that borders that hex. If there is not enough of a given
resource in the supply to fulfill everyone's production, then
no one receives any of that resource during that turn.
2. Trade?
Afterwards you may trade freely (using either or both types
of trades below) to gain needed Resource Cards:
a) Domestic Trade?
On your turn, you can trade Resource Cards with any of the
other players. You can announce which resources you need
and what you are willing to trade for them. The other players
can also make their own proposals and counter offers.
Important: Players may only trade with the player whose turn it is.
The other players may not trade among themselves.
b) Maritime Trade?
You can also trade without the other players!
During your turn, you can always trade at 4:1 by putting
4 identical Resource Cards back in their stack and taking any
1 Resource Card of your choice for it.
If you have a settlement or city on a harbor?, you can trade
with the bank more favorably: at either a 3:1 ratio or in special
harbors (trading the resource type shown) at 2:1.
Important: The 4:1 trade is always possible, even if you do not have
a settlement on a harbor.
3. Build?
Now you can build. Through building, you can increase your
victory points?, expand your road network, improve your
resource production, and/or buy useful Development Cards.
To build, you must pay specific combinations of Resource
Cards (see the Building Costs Card). Take the appropriate
number of roads, settlements, and/or cities from your supply
and place them on the game board. Keep Development Cards
hidden in your hand.
You cannot build more pieces than what is available in your
poola maximum of 5 settlements, 4 cities, and 15 roads.
a) Road? requires: Brick & Lumber
A new road must always connect to
1 of your existing roads, settlements,
or cities.
Only 1 road can be built on any
given path?.
The first player to build a continuous
road (not counting forks) of at least 5 road segments, receives
the Special Card "Longest Road"?. If another player succeeds
in building a longer road than the one created by the current
owner of the "Longest Road" card, he immediately takes the
Special Card (and its 2 victory points). In this case, there is a
4 victory point swing!
b) Settlement? requires: Brick, Lumber, Wool, & Grain
Take special note of the "Distance
Rule"?: you may only build a settlement at an intersection if all 3 of the
adjacent intersections are vacant
(i.e., none are occupied by any
settlements or citieseven yours).
Each of your settlements must
connect to at least 1 of your own roads.
Regardless of whose turn it is (i.e., during any production
phase), when a terrain hex produces resources, you receive 1
Resource Card for each settlement you have adjacent to that
terrain hex.
Each settlement is worth 1 victory point.
c) City? requires: 3 Ore & 2 Grain
You may only establish a city by
upgrading one of your settlements.
When you upgrade a settlement to a
city, put the settlement (house) piece
back in your supply and replace it
with a city piece (church).
Cities produce twice as many
resources as settlements. You acquire 2 Resource Cards for an
adjacent terrain hex that produces
resources.
Each city is worth 2 victory
points.
d) Buying Development Card?
requires: Ore, Wool, & Grain
When you buy a Development
Card, draw the top card from the deck. There are 3 different
kinds of these cards: Knight?; Progress?; and Victory
Point?. Each has a different effect (see 4.b. below).
Development Cards never go back into the supply, and you
cannot buy Development Cards if the supply is empty.
Keep your Development Cards hidden (in your hand) until
you use them, so your opponents can't anticipate your play.
4. Special Cases
a) Rolling a "7"? and Activating the Robber
If you roll a "7," no one receives any resources.
Instead, every player who has more than 7 Resource Cards
must select half (rounded down) of his Resource Cards and
return them to the bank.
Then you must move the robber?. Proceed as follows:
(1) You must move the robber? immediately to the number
token of any other terrain hex or to the desert? hex.
(2) Then you steal 1 (random) Resource Card from an
opponent who has a settlement or city adjacent to the
target terrain hex. The player who is robbed holds his
Resource Card hand face down. You then take 1 at random. If the target hex is adjacent to 2 or more players' settlements or cities, you choose which one you want to rob.
Important: If the production number for the hex containing the
robber is rolled, the owners of adjacent settlements and cities do not
receive resources. The robber prevents it.
b) Playing Development Cards?
At any time during your turn, you may
play 1 Development Card (on the table).
That card, however, may not be a card
you bought during the same turn!
Knight (aka "Soldier") Cards
(Red Frame)?
If you play a Knight Card, you must immediately move the
robber. See "Rolling a 7' and Activating the Robber" above
and follow steps 1 and 2.
Once played, Knight Cards remain face up in front of you.
The first player to have 3 Knight Cards in front of himself
receives the Special Card "Largest Army," which is worth
2 victory points. If another player has
more Knight Cards in front of him than
the current holder of the Largest Army
card, he immediately takes the Special
Card and its 2 victory points.
Progress Cards (Green Frame)?
If you play a Progress Card, follow its
instructions. Then the card is removed
from the game (i.e., tossed in the box).
Victory Point Cards (Yellow Frame)?
You must keep Victory Point Cards hidden. You may only
reveal them during your turn and when you are sure that you
have 10 victory pointsthat is, to win the game. Of course,
you can reveal them after the end of the game when someone
else wins. You may play any number of Victory Point Cards
during your turn, even during the turn you purchase them.
ENDING THE GAME
If you have 10 or more victory points during your turn
the game ends and you are the winner! If you reach 10 points
when it is not your turn, the game continues until any player
(including you) has 10 points on his turn.
This "Catan Almanac" contains detailed, alphabetical entries
and examples for The Settlers of Catan. These are not the
"Game Rules"! You do not have to read this material prior to
your first game. Instead, use the Game Rules. Then read this to
enjoy the complete experience.
This almanac includes advanced rules and clarifications. You
can also refer to it if any questions arise during a game.

BUILD (BUILDING):
You may build on your turn after you have rolled for
resource production and finished trading. To build, you must
turn in the specified combinations of Resource Cards (see the
Building Costs Cards?). Return the Resource Cards to the
supply stacks. You can build as many items and buy as many
cards as you desireas long as you have enough resources to
"pay" for them and they are still available in the supply. (See
Settlements?, Cities?, Roads?, and Development Cards?.)
Each player has a supply of 15 roads, 5 settlements, and 4
cities. If you build a city, return the settlement to your supply.
Roads and cities, however, remain on the board until the end
of the game once they are built.
Your turn is over after "building," and the player to your left
continues the game.
New rule variant: see Combined Trade/Build Phase?.
BUILDING COSTS CARDS
The Building Costs Cards show what can be built and which
resources are required. When you pay building costs, you must
return the necessary resources to their supply stacks. You can
build settlements? and roads?, upgrade settlements to
cities?, and buy Development Cards?.

CITIES:
You cannot build a city. You can only upgrade an existing
settlement to a city. You pay the required resources, return the
settlement to your supply, and replace the settlement with a
city on the same intersection?. Each city is worth 2 victory
points. You receive double resource production (2 Resource
Cards) from the adjacent terrain hexes whenever those
numbers are rolled.
When you build a city, the upgraded settlement piece
becomes available again. You can build more settlements later.
Example: See Illustration E. Claudia, the blue player, rolls a resource
production roll of "8." Claudia (blue) receives 3 ore cards: 1 ore for
her settlement and 2 ore for her city. Benny, the red player, receives
2 lumber for his city.
Hint: It is extremely difficult to win the game without upgrading
settlements into cities. Since you only have 5 settlements available,
you can only reach 5 victory points by only building settlements.

COAST:
When a terrain hex borders on the sea (i.e., a frame piece),
it is called a "coast." You can build a road along a coast. You
can build settlements and upgrade settlements to cities on
intersections that border on the sea. Since a site on the coast
borders only 1 or 2 terrain hexes, however, coastal settlements
generate smaller resource yields. Still, coastal sites often lie
on harbors, which allow you to use maritime trade? to trade
resources at more favorable rates.

COMBINED TRADE/BUILD PHASE:
The separation of the trade and build phases was introduced
to make the sequence easier to learn for beginners. We
recommend experienced players ignore this separation.
After rolling for resource production, you can trade and
build in any order. Naturally you can trade, build, trade again
and build again. You can even use a harbor on the same turn
you build a settlement there. This will also speed up the game.

DESERT:
The desert is the only terrain hex that
does not produce resources. The robber?
is native to the desert, and he starts the
game there. A settlement or a city built adjacent to the desert
yields fewer resources than than those built next to one of the
other terrain types.

DEVELOPMENT CARDS:
There are 3 different kinds of
Development Cards: Knights?,
Progress?, and Victory Points?.
When you buy a Development
Card, take the top card of the draw
stack into your hand. Keep your
Development Cards hidden until you
play them. This keeps the other players in the dark.
You cannot trade or give away Development Cards.
You may only play 1 Development Card during your turn
either 1 Knight Card or 1 Progress Card. You can play the
card at any time, even before you roll the dice. You may not,
however, play a card that you bought during the same turn.
Exception: If you buy a card and it is a Victory Point Card?
that brings you to 10 points, you may
immediately reveal this card (and all
other VP cards) and win the game.
You only reveal Victory Point Cards
when the game is overonce you
or an opponent reaches 10+ victory
points and declares victory.

DISTANCE RULE:
You may only build a settlement
on an open intersection? and only if none of the 3 adjacent
intersections contains a settlement or city.
Example: See Illustration F. Coleman, the blue player, wants to build
a settlement. The settlements marked "A" are already in play.
Coleman cannot build on the intersections marked "B." He can only
build at intersection "C."

DOMESTIC TRADE:
On your turn, you may trade resources with the other players
(after rolling for resource production). You and the other
players negotiate the terms of your tradessuch as which
cards will be exchanged. You may trade as many times as you
can, using single or multiple cards, but you may not give away
cards (i.e., "trade" 0 cards for 1 or more cards).
Important: While it is your turn you must be a part of all trades, the
other players may not trade amongst themselves.
Example: It is Pete's turn. He needs one brick to build a road. He
has 2 lumber and 3 ore. Pete asks aloud, "Who will give me 1 brick
for 1 ore?" Beth answers, "If you give me 3 ore, I'll give you a brick."
Cooper interjects, "I'll give you 1 brick if you give me 1 lumber and 1
ore." Pete accepts Cooper's offer and trades a lumber and an ore for
a brick. Note Beth may not trade with Cooper, since it is Pete's turn.

ENDING THE GAME:
If you have or reach10 victory
points on your turn, the game ends
immediately and you win! You can only
win during your turn. If somehow you
find you have 10 victory points during
another player's turn, you must wait
until your next turn to claim victory.
Example: Jhinuk has 2 settlements (2
points), the Longest Road special (2
points), 2 cities (4 points), and 2 Victory
Point Cards (2 points). She reveals her 2
Victory Point Cards, giving her the 10
points needed to win. She surprises her
opponents and claims victory!

GAME PLAY:
Here is a summary of the the game sequence, plus some
more specific entries where you can find details:
(1) Lay out the game board: Set-up, Variable?
(2) Initial set-up: Set-up Phase?
(3) Play.
The starting player begins the game. The other players follow
in clockwise order.
On your turn, you complete these 3 phases in order:
 Roll for Resource Production?
(the roll applies to all players).
 Trade?.
 Build?.
You may play 1 Development Card any time during your turn.
Pass the dice to the player on your left at the end of your
turn. He then takes his turn using the same 3 phases.

HARBORS:
Harbors allow you to trade
resources more favorably. In order to
control a harbor, you must build a settlement on a coastal intersection?
which borders the harbor. See also "Maritime Trade"?.

INTERSECTIONS:
Intersections are the
points where 3 hexes
meet. See Illustration
G. You may only build
settlements on intersections. The influence
(for resource yields)
of settlements and
cities extends into the
3 adjacent terrain
hexes that form the
intersection.

KNIGHT CARDS:
See "Soldier Cards."

LARGEST ARMY:
If you are the first player to play 3
Knight Cards, you receive this
Special Card, which is worth 2
victory points. You place the
"Largest Army" card face up in
front of you. If another player plays more Knight Cards than
you have, he immediately takes the Special Card. The 2 victory
points likewise count for the new owner.

LONGEST ROAD:
If you are the first player to build
a continuous road of at least 5
individual road pieces, you take this
Special Card and place it face up in
front of you. This card is worth 2
victory points.
Note: If your road network branches,
you may only count the single longest
branch for purposes of the longest road.
If you hold the "Longest Road" card and another player
builds a longer road, he immediately acquires your "Longest
Road" card. He also acquires the 2 bonus victory points.
(Since you also lose the 2 victory points, it is a 4 point swing!)
Example: See Illustration H. Emily, the red player, builds a continuous trade route with 7 roads (A-B). The branch roads marked with
arrows are not counted. Emily snags the "Longest Road" Special Card.
You can break an opponent's road by building a settlement
on an open intersection along his road!
Example: In the example on page 8, the blue player Coleman builds
a settlement on intersection "C" (which would be legal). This breaks
Emily's road into 2 parts. Emily must give the Special Card to
Coleman, who now has the Longest Road (and 2 more VPs).
Set the "Longest Road" card aside if after a longest road is
broken several players tie for the new longest road or no
one has a 5+ segment road. The "Longest Road" card comes
into play again when only 1 player has the longest road (of at
least 5 road pieces).

MARITIME TRADE:
On your turn, you can trade resources using maritime trade
during the trade phase even without involving another player.
The most basic (and unfavorable) exchange rate is 4:1. You
may trade 4 identical Resource Cards to the supply in
exchange for the (1) Resource Card of your choice. You do
not need a harbor? (settlement at a harbor location) to trade
at 4:1, so when nobody wants to trade...
Example: Benny returns 4 ore cards to the supply and takes
1 lumber card in exchange. Normally, he should first try a more
favorable trade with the other players (domestic trade).
If you have built a settlement or city at a harbor? location,
you can trade more effectively. There are 2 different kinds of
harbor locations:
Generic Harbor (3:1): Here you may exchange 3 identical
Resource Cards for any one other Resource Card during
your trade phase.
Example: Olivia, the red player, has
built a settlement at a generic harbor.
She can, for instance, exchange
3 lumber cards for 1 wool card.
Special Harbor (2:1): There is
but 1 special harbor for each
type of resource (with the same
symbol). So, it is important to
build on the type of special
harbor you can use fairly
frequently. (Look at your
resource production.)
The exchange rate of 2:1 only
applies to the resource shown
on the harbor location.
A special harbor does not permit you to trade any other
resource type at a more favorable rate (not even 3:1)!
Example: Nick, the orange player, built a settlement at the ore
special harbor. Nick may exchange 2 ore cards for any 1 other
Resource Card. He can also trade 4 ore cards for any 2 other cards. If
he traded 4 wool instead of 4 ore, he would get only 1 card in return.

NUMBER TOKENS (CHITS):
The 18 number tokens are marked with the numerals "2"
through "12." There is only one "2" and one "12." There is
no "7."
The more often a number is rolled, the more often each
associated hex produces resources. Note the dots (pips)
beneath the numbers on the tokens. The larger the number of
dots, the more likely it is that number will be rolled. "6" and
"8" are the most frequently rolled numbers. They each have 5
dots, for there are 5 ways to roll these numbers on the 2 dice.
The small letters on the top of the number markers are
important during the setup phase (see Set-up Phase?).

PATHS:
Paths are defined as the edges
where two hexes meet. Paths run
along the border of two terrain
hexes or between a land hex and the
frame. Only one road? can be built
on any path. Each path leads to an
intersection? where 3 hexes meet.

PROGRESS CARDS:
Progress Cards are a type of Development Card. They have
green frames. There are 2 each of 3 varieties:
Road Building: If you play this card, you may immediately
place 2 free roads on the board (according to normal
building rules).
Year of Plenty: If you play this card you may immediately
take any 2 Resource Cards from the supply stacks. You
may use these cards to build in the same turn.
Monopoly: If you play this card, you must name 1 type of
resource. All the other players must give you all of the
Resource Cards of this type that they have in their hands.

If an opponent does not have a Resource Card of the
specified type, he does not have to give you anything.
You may play only 1 Development Card? during your turn.

RESOURCE CARDS:
There are 5 different types of resources
(see page 3): grain (from fields),
brick (from hills), ore (from mountains),
lumber (from forest), and wool (from
pasture). You receive these cards as income from the resource
production of these hexes. Resource production is determined
by the dice roll at the beginning of each turn. You receive your
income for each terrain hex adjacent to your settlements or
cities every time the production number on the hex is rolled
(exception: see Robber?).

RESOURCE PRODUCTION:
On your turn, you must roll the dice for the turn's resource
production. The number rolled determines which hexes
produce resources. Each number appears twice except for
"2" and "12," which only appear once.
All players who have settlements? or cities? on the hexes
indicated by the roll
receive the yields
(Resource Cards) of
those hexes. Each settlement produces 1
Resource Card; each
city 2 Resource Cards.
Example: Loren, the
blue player, rolls a "4".
Her settlement "A" borders a pasture marked by the number "4", so
she takes a wool card. If settlement "A" had been a city, she would
have received 2 wool cards. Bridget owns the red settlement "B" that
borders on 2 hexes with the number "4": mountains and pasture.
Bridget takes 1 ore card and 1 wool card from the supply stacks.
It is possible that during the game there will not be enough
resources in the bank to supply all of the yields. If there are
not enough Resource Cards to give every player all the production they earn, then no player receives any of that resource that
turn. Production of other types of resources is not affected.

RESOURCE TRADE:
In the second phase of your turn, you may trade with the
other players. The other players may not trade amongst
themselves, only with the
player whose turn it is. There
are 2 different kinds of trade:
 domestic trade? and
 maritime trade?.

ROADS:
The roads connect your
settlements and cities. You
build roads on paths?. You
cannot build new settlements
without also building roads. Roads provide victory points only
if you hold the Longest Road? Special Card. Only 1 road may
be built on each path. You can build roads along the coast.
Example: Liam, the red player, would like to build a road. He may
build (place) his road on any of the paths marked with arrows. Each
of these paths connects to either Liam's road or his settlement.

ROBBER:
The robber begins the game in
the desert?. It is moved only by
rolling a "7"? or playing a
Knight? Card.
If the robber is moved to any
other terrain hex, he prevents that
hex from producing resources.
Players with settlements and/or cities adjacent to the target
terrain hex receive no resources from this hex as long as the
robber is in the hex.
Example: See Illustration I. It is Xander's turn and he rolls a "7." He
must move the robber. The robber was in a fields hex. Xander places
it on the "4" number token of a hills hex. If a "4" is rolled in the
coming turns, the owners of settlements "A" and "B" do not receive a
brick Resource Card. This lasts until the robber is moved again by
another "7" or a Knight Card. Xander may also take 1 Resource Card
at random from 1 of the players who own settlements "A" or "B".

ROLLING A "7" AND ACTIVATING THE ROBBER:
If you roll a "7" for resource production, none of the players
receive resources. Instead:
(1) Each player counts his Resource Cards. Any player with
more than 7 Resource Cards (i.e., 8 or more), must
choose and discard half of them. Return discards to the
supply stacks. If you hold an odd number of cards, round
down (e.g., if you have 9 Resource Cards, you discard 4).
Example: Alex rolls a "7". He has only 6 cards in his hand. Larry has
8 cards and Will has 11. Larry must discard 4 cards and Will 5
(rounding down).
(2) Then you (the player who rolled the "7") must move
the robber? to the number token? of any other terrain
hex (or to the desert? hex). This blocks the resource
production of this hex, until the robber moves to another
number token.
(3) After discarding occurs, you also steal 1 Resource Card at
random from a player who has a settlement or city
adjacent to this new hex. If there are 2 or more players with
buildings there, you may choose from which one to steal.
The robber must be moved. You may not choose to leave the
robber in the same hex.
After moving the robber, your turn continues with the trade
phase.
See also Knights and Soldiers?.

SETTLEMENTS:
A settlement is worth 1 victory point.
Settlements are built on intersections? (where
3 hexes meet). You share in all of the resource
production of each terrain hex adjacent to your settlements.
You must meet 2 conditions when building a settlement:
(1) Your settlement must always connect to 1 or more of
your own roads?.
(2) You must observe the Distance Rule?.
Example: See Illustration J. Olivia, the blue player, wants to build a
new settlement. She may only do so at one of the intersections
marked "B". She cannot build on "A" because of the Distance Rule,
nor on "C" because no blue road leads to this intersection.
Note: If you have built all 5 of your settlements, you must upgrade 1
of your settlements to a city before you can build another settlement.
You will then have the settlement in your supply, so you can build
another settlement.

SET-UP PHASE:
Begin the "set-up
phase" after you
build the game map
(see Illustration K
and Set-up,
Variable?).
Everyone chooses
a color and takes
the corresponding
game pieces:
 5 settlements;
 4 cities;
 15 roads; and
 1 Building Costs Card.
Sort the Resource Cards into 5 stacks and place them face
up beside the board.
Shuffle the Development Cards? and place them face down
beside the Resource Cards.
Place the 2 Special Cards and the dice beside the board.
Place the robber in the desert.
The set-up phase has 2 rounds. Each player builds 1 road
and 1 settlement per round.
Round One
Each player rolls both dice. The player who rolls highest is
the starting player and begins.
Suggested Beginners' Map Set-up
The starting player places a settlement on an open intersection? of his
choice. He places a road adjacent to
this settlement.
The other players then follow clockwise. Everyone places 1 settlement and
1 adjoining road.
Important: When placing all settlements, the Distance Rule?
always applies!
Round Two
Once all players have built their first settlements, the player
who went last in the first round begins round two: he builds
his second settlement and its adjacent road.
Note: After he builds, the other players follow counterclockwise, so
the starting player in Round One places his second settlement last.
The second settlement can be placed on any open intersection, as long as the Distance Rule is observed. It doesn't have
to connect to the first settlement. The second road must attach
to the second settlement (pointing in any of the 3 directions).
Each player receives his starting resources immediately after
building his second settlement; for each terrain hex adjacent
to this second settlement, he takes a corresponding Resource
Card from the supply.
Note: The starting player (the last to place his second settlement)
begins the game: He rolls both dice for resource production. You can
find helpful tips about the set-up phase under "Tactics."

SET-UP, VARIABLE:
Assemble the frame as outlined on pages 2-3.
Note: If you want to vary relative harbor locations slightly, just
shuffle the order of the frame pieces AND do not place the random
harbor pieces as outlined below in point 2.
Turn the terrain hexes face down. Shuffle the terrain hexes.
1. Randomly place the terrain tiles face up inside the frame
arranged as shown in Illustration L.
2. Now take the
9 harbor pieces
(the small 5-
sided pieces with
ships on them)
and randomly
place one on top
of each harbor
on the frame. See
Illustration M.
3. Place the 18 number tokens as shown in Illustration N:
 Sort the number
tokens beside the
board.
 Place 1 token on
each land hex.
Start at a corner
of the island.
Place the number
tokens on the terrain hexes in
alphabetical
order, proceding
counter-clockwise toward the center. Skip the desert.
Important: Alternatively, you can use a fully random set-up. Place 1
token on each land hex. Start at one corner of the island, and place
the number tokens in random order. In such case, the tokens with
the red numbers must not be next to each other. You may have to
swap tokens to ensure that no red numbers are on adjacent hexes.
Note: The desert never gets a number token. It should be skipped.
More set-up instructions can be found in "Set-up Phase."?
SOLDIER (KNIGHT) CARDS
When you play a "Knight" Development Card during
your turn, you must immediately move the robber?.
Place the Knight Card face up in front of you.
You must move the robber away from his current spot and
onto the number token of any other terrain hex.
You then steal 1 Resource Card from a player who has a
settlement or a city adjacent to the robber. If there are 2 or
more such players, you may choose your victim.
The player you elect to rob keeps his cards face down while
you take 1 of his cards at random. If he has no cards, you get
nothing! (However, you can always ask players about the
number of cards they hold.)
If you are the first player to have 3 Knight Cards face up in
front of you, you take the "Largest Army"? Special Card. This
Special Card is worth 2 victory points.
If another player has more Knight Cards than you, he takes
the Special Card, and the 2 victory points that go with it.
Example: See Illustration O. On Al's turn he plays a Knight Card and
moves the robber from the fields hex to the hills hex with the "4." Al
may now steal a random card from player A or B.
STARTING SET-UP FOR BEGINNERS
If you want to use the starting set-up illustrated in Illustration
P (and Game Overview), lay out the board as shown:
 Assemble the frame exactly as shown in Illustration P.
 Place the terrain hexes exactly as shown in Illustration P.
 Place 2 settlements and 2 roads of each color as shown.
If only 3 are playing, remove the red pieces.
 Each player receives the 3 resources from the terrain
hexes adjacent to his settlement marked by the white star.
The oldest player is the starting player. The oldest player
takes the first turn and rolls for resource production.

TACTICS:
Since you play The Settlers of Catan with a variable map, the
tactical considerations of each game are different. There are,
nevertheless, some common points you should consider:
 Brick and lumber are the most important resources at the
beginning of the game. You need both to build roads and
settlements. You should try to place at least 1 of your first
settlements on a good forest or hills hex.
 Do not underestimate the value of harbors. For instance,
a player with settlements or cities on productive fields
should try to build a settlement on the "grain" harbor.
 Leave enough room to expand when placing your first
2 settlements. Look at your opponents' sites and
roads before making a placement. Beware of getting
surrounded! If you plan to build toward a harbor, the
middle of the island may be a tricky place for a starting
settlement, for it can easily be cut off from the coast.
 The more you trade, the better your chances of
victory. Even if it is not your turn, you should offer
trades to the current player!

TRADE:
After you roll for resource production, you may trade
with other players (domestic trade?) or with the bank
(maritime trade?).
If you decide not to trade during your turn, no one
can trade.
You may trade with another player between your
turns, but only if it is his turn and he elects to trade
with you. You cannot trade with the bank during
another player's turn. You may not give away cards.
You may trade as long as you have Resource Cards. Illustration P
Illustration O
You may not trade Development
Cards. You may not trade like
resources (e.g., 2 wool for 1 wool).

VICTORY POINT CARDS:
Victory Point Cards are yellow
frame Development Cards?, so
they can be "bought." These Development Cards represent
important cultural achievements, represented by certain
buildings.
Each Victory Point Card is worth 1 victory point.
You only reveal your Victory Point Cards when you or someone else wins the game! Keep Victory Point Cards hidden until
you have 10 points during your turn and you can declare
victory. (You should also reveal them if someone else wins.)
Hint: Again, keep your Victory Point Cards hidden until the end of
the game. Place them face down in front of you. Of course, if you
have 1 or 2 unused cards face
down in front of you for a
long time, the other players
will assume that they are
Victory Point Cards.

VICTORY POINTS:
The first player to reach
(be at) 10 victory points
on his turn wins the game.
Players acquire victory
points (VPs) for the
following:
1 Settlement = 1 VP
1 City = 2 VPs
Longest Road
Special Card = 2 VPs
Largest Army
Special Card = 2 VPs
Victory Point Card = 1 VP
Since each player begins
with 2 settlements, each
player begins the game
with 2 victory points.
Therefore, you only need
8 more victory points to
win the game!

GAME NAME:
ONE NIGHT ULTIMATE WEREWOLF

In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, each player takes on the role of a Villager, a Werewolf,
or a special character. It's your job to figure out who the Werewolves are and to kill
at least one of them in order to win...unless you've become a Werewolf yourself!

CONTENTS:
- 3 Villagers
- 2 Werewolves
- 1 Seer
- 1 Robber
- 1 Troublemaker
- 1 Tanner
- 1 Drunk
- 1 Hunter
- 2 Masons
- 1 Insomniac
- 1 Minion

BASIC SETUP:
Setup differs based on the number of players (3-10).
For your first game, it's recommended that you play
a 3-5 player game to get a quick sense of gameplay
(If you have more, don't worry. The game is very
quick and everyone else will enjoy watching).
Include the following cards:
3 players 4 Players 5 Players
2 Werewolves
1 Seer 1 Robber
1 Troublemaker
1 Villager
+1 Villager +2 Villagers
There should always be three more cards than
the number of players. Shuffle the selected cards
face down and deal one to each player. Put the
remaining three cards and tokens that match all
the cards being used in the middle of the table.
Each player should secretly view their card, and
place it face down near the three cards in the
center of the table. All players should be able to
reach all cards easily, as shown in the example for
5 players below:

NIGHT:
There are several roles that are called on at night to
do a night action. However, players with a Villager,
Tanner, or Hunter card never wake up at night.
In addition to having a role card, one player is des- ignated the Announcer and announces each of the
roles in order and silently counts to ten after each
role is woken up to allow the players with that role
to perform their action at night. Use this script
with the previously suggested cards:
Announcer: "Everyone, close your eyes."
All players close their eyes (including the
Announcer).
"Werewolves, wake up and look for other
werewolves."
The werewolves open their eyes and look for
anyone else whose eyes are open (there might
not be any others).
"Werewolves, close your eyes. Seer, wake up.
You may look at another player's card or two
of the center cards."
The player with the Seer card opens her eyes
and may quietly look at one other player's
card or any two of the cards in the center.
"Seer, close your eyes. Robber, wake up.
You may exchange your card with another
player's card, and then view your new card."
The player with the Robber card opens his eyes
and may quietly exchange his card for another
player's card, which he looks at.
"Robber, close your eyes. Troublemaker,
wake up. You may exchange cards between
two other players."
The player with the Troublemaker card opens her
eyes and may quietly exchange the cards of two
other players without looking at those cards.
"Troublemaker, close your eyes."
The Announcer, keeping his eyes closed, moves
the cards around slightly (this ensures no
one can claim a card was moved/inspected
because it is no longer in its original position).
" Everyone, Wake up!"
All players open their eyes and look around
suspiciously.
At night, players who are not active (whose eyes
are closed) may not move, point, or do anything
to communicate with the active player(s).

DAY:
After the night phase, players discuss amongst
themselves who they believe the Werewolves are.
All players may say anything, but may never show
their card to anyone. Werewolves might want to
claim to be a different role so that they don't die.
Because certain roles change other players' cards,
some players will believe they are one role, when
they are actually a different one. After the night
phase, your role is the card that is currently in
front of you, which may be different than your
original role. No one may look at any cards after
the night phase.
After a few minutes of discussion, players vote.
"Everyone, three, two, one, VOTE!"
Each player points to another player.
The player with the most votes dies and reveals
his card. In case of a tie, all players tied with the
most votes die and reveal their cards.
If no player receives more than one vote, no one
dies. One way the players might achieve this is if
everyone votes in the same direction around the
table, with each player receiving one vote (decide
this as a group before you vote).
GAME END
After just one night and one day...
The village team wins:
1) If at least one Werewolf dies. Even if one
or more players who are not Werewolves die
in addition to a Werewolf dying, everyone
on the village team wins.
2) If no one is a Werewolf and no one dies.
It is possible for no one to be a Werewolf if
all Werewolf cards are in the center.
The werewolf team only wins if at least one play- er is a Werewolf and no Werewolves are killed.
If you are playing with the Tanner, there are special rules regarding who wins; see the Tanner's
role description for details.
ANNOUNCER TIPS
As the Announcer, place any tokens with num- bers on them near you, and open your eyes in
between roles if you need to check the night
wake order. Otherwise keep your eyes closed during the night. You may want to tap on the table
during the night to cover up any sounds made
by the different players when they are looking at
and moving cards. If you call your own role, don't
speak while performing your action.
When introducing players to the game for the
first time, or introducing new roles, be sure to
pause during the "action" section of each role you
call to give players enough time to decide what to
do and to complete their action.

GET THE FREE APP:
Instead of having an Announcer, you can simply
use the free app for mobile devices available at
www.beziergames.com. This app calls out the
roles you're using in order, provides some back- ground noise, and also has a timer for the day
phase. You can even set it to move quickly once the
players are comfortable with all the roles.
The app works on both Android and iOS devices
and is completely free!

OTHER TIPS:
The length of time it takes for discussion during
the day phase is up to the players. With larger
groups, you'll need a bit more time than with
smaller groups. After a few plays with a few larger
groups, consider using a timer; when the timer
goes off, everyone must vote. This adds a sense of
urgency to the discussions, and will result in less
non-relevant conversations during the day.
Playing with higher player numbers (7+) can
make it difficult for everyone to reach the middle
of the table. Standing at the table during the
Night phase can make reaching easier, and using
a smaller table can also help. If you have to use a
long "banquet" table, try to position the players
on the long sides of it, and not the ends.

TOURNAMENT PLAY:
Set up a mini tournament by providing the winners of each game with a poker chip or other
small item. Once any player has obtained a specified number of chips, such as five, the player with
the most chips wins. Continue playing if there is a
tie until one player has the most chips.
For larger tournaments with multiple games, do
a double-elimination style tournament, where
players play until they have lost twice.

USING OTHER ROLES:
You may use additional roles in your games be- yond the basic setup. Just take out a card and
replace it with a different one. You may use
virtually any combination of cards, though you
probably don't want to introduce more than 1 or
2 new roles at a time, so players can easily under- stand them.
Regardless of which roles are present, you must
always have 3 more cards than players.
Before each round, place a token that corre- sponds to each of the cards near the Announcer.
This way everyone will know what roles are in
the game, and the Announcer will know in what
order to call them.
Be creative in your role selection: Try having a
single Werewolf, or shuffling all of the cards and
dealing them out to players entirely randomly!
You can even create a village with no Villager
cards...that way everyone has a special role.

ROLES THAT WAKE UP AT NIGHT:
These roles wake up at night in the following
order (see the chart on the back page for a nice
compressed list that's easy to refer to). Within
each of the role descriptions is a sample script
which the Announcer may use:

DOPPELGNGER:
The Doppelgnger is a fairly
complicated card, because she
takes on the role and team of
whatever card she views. If you
haven't played with most of the
other roles yet, skip this section
for now...it will make a lot more sense then.
The Doppelgnger wakes up before the other
roles.
At night, the Doppelgnger looks at (but does not
switch) one other player's card and does the fol- lowing based on what she sees:
Villager, Tanner, Hunter: She is now that role
and does nothing else at night.
Werewolf or Mason: She wakes up with the
other Werewolves or Masons when they are
called. She is on the werewolf team if she views a
Werewolf, and is on the village team if she views
a Mason.
Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, Drunk: She im- mmediately does that role's action (she does not
wake up again with the original role when it is
called).
Minion: At the end of the Doppelgnger phase,
the Announcer tells the Doppelgnger to close
her eyes unless she is now the Minion, and that
werewolves should put their thumbs up. She is on
the werewolf team.
Insomniac: After the Insomniac closes her eyes,
the Doppelgnger-Insomniac is woken up to
check her card to see if she is still the Doppelgn- ger.
If a player receives the Doppelgnger card during
the night, she is the role the Doppelgnger origi- nally viewed. The Doppelgnger's script at night
is a little different than most, as she has to be told
to look for werewolves if she is the Minion, and is
woken up later at night if the Insomniac is pres- ent. Use the following script if there is no Minion
in the game:
"Doppelganger, wake up and look at
another player's card. You are now that
role. If your new role has a night action,
do it now."
The Doppelgnger opens her eyes and looks
at one other player's card. If the viewed card is
the Seer, Robber, Troublemaker, or Drunk, she
does that action right now. If the viwed card
is a Werewolf or Mason, she wakes up when
those roles are called. If the viewed card is a
Villager, Tanner or Hunter, she does nothing.
"Doppelgnger, close your eyes."
If there is a Minion in the game, use this script:
"Doppelgnger, wake up and look at
another player's card. You are now that
role. If your new role has a night action,
do it now."
The Doppelgnger opens her eyes and looks
at one other player's card. If the viewed card is
the Seer, Robber, Troublemaker or Drunk, she
does that action right now. If the viewed card
is a werewolf or Mason, she wakes up when
those roles are called. If the viewed card is a
Villager, Tanner or Hunter, she does nothing.
"If you are now a Minion, keep your eyes
open. Otherwise, close them. Werewolves,
stick out your thumb so the DoppelgngerMinion can see who you are."
If the Doppelgnger is a Minion, she keeps
her eyes open; otherwise, she closes them.
The werewolves stick out a thumb for the
Doppelgnger-Minion to see.
"Werewolves, put your thumbs away. Dop- pelgnger, close your eyes."
If there is an Insomniac in the game, after the In- somniac has been called, use the following script:
"Doppelgnger, if you viewed the Insom- niac card, wake up and look at your card."
The Doppelgnger opens her eyes and looks
at her card to see if has changed during the
night.
"Doppelgnger, close your eyes."

WEREWOLF:
At night, all Werewolves open
their eyes and look for other
werewolves. If no one else opens
their eyes, the other Werewolves
are in the center. Werewolves are
on the werewolf team.
"Werewolves, wake up and look for other
Werewolves."
The Werewolves open their eyes and look
for anyone else whose eyes are open (there
might not be any others).
"Werewolves, close your eyes."
Lone Wolf Option: If there is only one Werewolf,
the Werewolf may view one center card. This is
extremely beneficial to a Werewolf who doesn't
have a partner, and provides him with a useful
tool for deceiving the rest of the players.

MINION:
Immediately following the Werewolf phase at night, the Minion
wakes up and sees who the Werewolves are. During this phase, all
Werewolves put their thumbs up
so the Minion can see who they
are. The Werewolves don't know who the Minion
is. If the Minion dies and no Werewolves die, the
Werewolves (and the Minion) win. If no players
are Werewolves, the Minion wins as long as one
other player (not the Minion) dies. This role can
be a very powerful ally for the werewolf team.
This Minion is on the werewolf team.
"Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out
your thumb so the Minion can see who
you are."
The Minion opens his eyes. The Werewolves
stick out a thumb for the Minion to see. The
Minions look around to see which players are
Werewolves.
"Werewolves, put your thumbs away.
Minion, close your eyes."

MASON:
When using the Masons always
put both Masons in the game.
The Mason wakes up at night and
looks for the other Mason. If the
Mason doesn't see another Mason,
it means the other Mason card is in
the center. Masons are on the village team.
"Masons, wake up and look for other
Masons."
The Masons open their eyes and look for
anyone else whose eyes are open (there
might not be any others).
"Masons, close your eyes."

SEER:
At night, the Seer may look ei- ther at one other player's card
or at two of the center cards, but
does not move them. The Seer is
on the village team.
"Seer, wake up. You may look at another
player's card or two of the center cards."
The player with the Seer card opens her eyes
and may quietly look at one other player's
card or any two of the cards in the center.
"Seer, close your eyes."
ROBBER
At night, the Robber may choose
to rob a card from another player
and place his Robber card where
the other card was. Then the
Robber looks at his new card. The
player who receives the Robber
card is on the village team. The Robber is on the
team of the card he takes, however, he does not do
the action of his new role at night.
If the Robber chooses not to rob a card from an- other player, he remains the Robber and is on the
village team.
"Robber, wake up. You may exchange your
card with another player's card, and then
view your new card."
The player with the Robber card opens his
eyes and may quietly exchange his card for
another player's card, which he looks at.
"Robber, close your eyes.

TROUBLEMAKER:
At night, the Troublemaker may
switch the cards of two other
players without looking at those
cards. The players who receive
a different card are now the role
(and team) of their new card, even
though they don't know what role that is until
the end of the game. The Troublemaker is on the
village team.
"Troublemaker, wake up. You may ex- change cards between two other players."
The player with the Troublemaker card opens her
eyes and may quietly exchange the cards of two
other players without looking at those cards.
"Troublemaker, close your eyes."

DRUNK:
The Drunk is so drunk that he
doesn't remember his role. When
it comes time to wake up at night,
he must exchange his Drunk card
for any card in the center, but he
does not look at it. The Drunk is now the new role
in front of him (even though he doesn't know
what that new role is) and is on that team.
"Drunk, wake up and exchange your card
with a card from the center."
The player with the Drunk card opens his
eyes and exchanges his card for one of the
three center cards, but does not view his
new card.
"Drunk, close your eyes."

INSOMNIAC:
The Insomniac wakes up and
looks at her card (to see if it has
changed). Only use the Insomni- ac if the Robber and/or the Trou- blemaker are in the game. The
Insomniac is on the village team.
"Insomniac, wake up and look at your card."
The player with the Insomniac card opens
her eyes and looks at her own card to see if it
has changed during the night.
"Insomniac, close your eyes."

NO-WAKE ROLES:
The following roles do not wake up at night:

VILLAGER:
The Villager has no special abili- ties, but he is definitely not a
werewolf. Players may often claim
to be a Villager. The Villager is on
the village team.

TANNER:
The Tanner hates his job so much
that he wants to die. The Tanner
only wins if he dies. If the Tanner
dies and no Werewolves die, the
Werewolves do not win. If the Tan- ner dies and a Werewolf also dies,
the village team wins too. The Tanner is consid- ered a member of the village (but is not on their
team), so if the Tanner dies when all werewolves
are in the center, the village team loses. The Tan- ner is not on the werewolf or the villager team.

HUNTER:
If the Hunter dies, the player he
is pointing at dies as well (regardless of how many votes his target
receives). The Hunter is on the village team.

USING ROLE TOKENS:
One Night Ultimate Werewolf includes role tokens
that match each of the cards. You can use these in
a few different ways:
1. Display what roles are in play during each
game: Put the roles that are being used face
up near the center of the table, so everyone
can see which roles (and how many of each)
are in the current game. The numbers on the
tokens correspond to the night wake order.
2. Randomly select the roles that are in each
game: place the tokens in a bag and draw out
the number of roles you need (the number of
players plus three).
3. During the day phase of the game, players can
use the tokens to help them deduce players'
roles by placing appropriate tokens on top of
cards that they've "verified."

THE ORIGINAL ONE NIGHT WEREWOLF:
The original game was
released in January 2013, and despite being an
indie game, sold 10,000 copies in six months, be- coming an unprecedented hit. The English version
of the original game debuted in October 2013 at
the Essen Spiel fair. By being playable with 3-7
players, taking only ten minutes with no down- time, it overcame some of the issues with certain
Werewolf games that need a large amount of
players and take a long time to play.
It became the basis for One Night Ulti- mate Werewolf which expanded on the
same idea, with One Night Werewolf
being the lighter, compact version
and One Night Ultimate Werewolf the
deluxe version.
One Night Werewolf can be purchased directly for
$15 at http://www.beziergames.com or anywhere
else Bezier Games products are sold.

including Ultimate Werewolf and Suburbia. He re- sides in a secluded fortress somewhere in North- ern California with his wife, son, daughter, dog,
and two cats, all of whom claim not to be were- wolves. Ted doesn't believe any of them.
Akihisa Okui is a designer who recently popped
up in the Japanese indie board game scene. His
game One Night Werewolf became the 2013 best
selling board game in Japan.

GAME NAME:
LOVE LETTER

The guard looked Bartolemew
Kaiss up and down for a moment
and then frowned. "I'm sorry,
Master Kaiss, but the princess is
not seeing visitors at this time. She
is, of course, in despair over the
arrest of her mother."
"Of course," the young composer
said, nodding and looking
appropriately sympathetic. "But I
am not just visiting, you see. Her
Highness requested my instruction.
We are to practice her singing."
"The princess already has a vocal
maestro," the gruff woman replied,
raising an eyebrow.
"I'm sure he knows that, Odette,"
said a kind voice echoing down the
hall that connected the residence to
the palace. The two turned to see
Susannah, one of Princess Annette's
handmaids, walking toward them.
"What the good composer means
to say is that Annette requested his
work for their practice." The young
woman smiled at the guard and
gave Bartolemew a conspiratorial
wink.
From his satchel, Bartolemew
produced a sealed tube. "If you will
be so kind as to deliver these sheets
of music, my dear Susannah," he
said with a smile and a genteel nod.
The guard took the tube from him,
but as it changed hands, something
with a little weight shifted inside
the tube. "What's this, then?" the
guard asked, jostling it next to her
ear.
Certainly not a small statue of a bird
the Princess is so fond of, Bartolemew
thought. "The... quill and ink I
used to pen the music, in case she
or the maestro wish to make any
changes. I always deliver some with
a new composition."
Susannah gently took the case
from the suspicious guard. "Oh,
would you stop, Odette? It's just
some music," she chided playfully.
"I'll see to it that milady gets
these," she added with a hand on
Bartolemew's arm. "I'm sure she'll
be eager to see the contents."
object
In the wake of the arrest of Queen
Marianna for high treason, none
was more heartbroken than her
daughter, Princess Annette.
Suitors throughout the CityState of Tempest sought to ease
Annette's sorrow by courting her to
bring some joy into her life.
You are one of these suitors, trying
to get your love letter to the
princess. Unfortunately, she has
locked herself in the palace, so you
must rely on intermediaries to carry
your message.
During the game, you hold one
secret card in your hand. This is
who currently carries your message
of love for the princess.
Make sure that the person closest to
the princess holds your love letter
at the end of the day, so it reaches
her first!

COMPONENTS:
Your game of Love Letter should
include the following. If it does
not, contact customerservice@
alderac.com for assistance.
- 16 game cards
- 4 reference cards
- tokens of affection

GAME CARDS:
The game has 16 cards. Each
different card name represents
someone at the royal residence.
Each card has a value in the upper
left cornerthe higher the number,
the closer that person is to the
princess. At the bottom of each
card, a text box describes the effect
when the card is discarded.
reference cards
These list the various cards in the
game, as well as their effects and
how many copies are in the deck.
They are not used in the game, but
are provided as a memory aid.
tokens of affection
Red tokens are also included. These
are used to track Princess Annette's
ever-growing affection for those
suitors whose letters reach her.

SETUP:
Shuffle the 16 cards to form a
face-down draw deck. Remove the
top card of the deck from the game
without looking at it.
If you are playing a two-player
game, take three more cards from
the top of the deck and place them
to the side, face up. They will not
be used during this round.
Each player draws one card from
the deck. This is the player's hand,
and is kept secret from the others.
Whoever was most recently on a
date goes first (if tied, the younger
player wins the tie).

HOW TO PLAY:
Love Letter is played in a series
of rounds. Each round represents
one day. At the end of each round,
one player's letter reaches Princess
Annette, and she reads it.
When she reads enough letters from
one suitor, she becomes enamored
and grants that suitor permission
to court her. That player wins the
princess's heart and the game.

TAKING A TURN:
On your turn, draw the top card
from the deck and add it to your
hand. Then choose one of the two
cards in your hand and discard it
face up in front of you. Apply any
effect on the card you discarded.
You must apply its effect, even if it
is bad for you.
See page 15 for the effects of each
individual card. Likewise, if you
have any questions about special
cases regarding the card, you'll find
the answer there.
All discarded cards remain in front
of the player who discarded them.
Overlap the cards so that it's clear
in which order they were discarded.
This helps players to figure out
which cards other players might be
holding.
Once you finish applying the card's
effect, the turn passes to the player
on your left.

OUT OF THE ROUND:
If a player is knocked out of the
round, that player discards the card
in his or her hand face up (do not
apply the card's effect) and takes
no more turns until next round.

HONESTY:
A player could cheat when chosen
with the Guard, or fail to discard
the Countess when that player has
the King or Prince in hand. We
suggest that you don't play with
knaves who cheat at fun, light games.

END OF A ROUND:
A round ends if the deck is empty
at the end of a turn. The royal
residence closes for the evening,
the person closest to the princess
delivers the love letter, and Princess
Annette retires to her chambers to
read it.
All players still in the round reveal
their hands. The player with the
highest ranked person wins the
round. In case of a tie, the player
who discarded the highest total
value of cards wins.
A round also ends if all players but
one are out of the round, in which
case the remaining player wins.
The winner receives a token of
affection. Shuffle all 16 cards
together, and play a new round
following all of the setup rules.
The winner of the previous round
goes first, because the princess
speaks kindly of him or her at
breakfast.

WINNING:
A player wins the game after
winning a number of tokens based
on the number of players:
 2 Players 7 tokens
 3 Players 5 tokens
 4 players 4 tokens

THE PEOPLE:
The events of this game take place
between the events of Courtier
and Dominare, two other games
in the Tempest line. Here are brief
profiles of the people in the game.
8: princess annette
Hampered only by the navete of youth,
Princess Annette is elegant, charming,
and beautiful. Obviously, you want the
princess to carry your letter. However,
she is self-conscious about matters of the
heart, and if confronted, will toss your
letter in the fire and deny ever seeing it.
If you discard the Princess no
matter how or why she has tossed
your letter into the fire. You are
knocked out of the round.

7: countess wilhelmina
Always on the prowl for a handsome
man or juicy gossip, Wilhelmina's age
and noble blood make her one of Princess
Annette's friends. While she has great
influence over the princess, she makes
herself scarce whenever the king or
prince are around.
Unlike other cards, which take
effect when discarded, the text on
the Countess applies while she is
in your hand. In fact, she has no
effect when you discard her.
If you ever have the Countess
and either the King or Prince in
your hand, you must discard the
Countess. You do not have to reveal
the other card in your hand. Of
course, you can also discard the
Countess even if you do not have a
royal family member in your hand.
She likes to play mind games....

6: king arnaud iv
The undisputed ruler of Tempest... for
the moment. Because of his role in the
arrest of Queen Marianna, he does not
rate as highly with Princess Annette as a
father should. He hopes to work himself
back into her graces.
When you discard King Arnaud IV,
trade the card in your hand with
the card held by another player of
your choice. You cannot trade with
a player who is out of the round,
nor with someone protected by the
Handmaid. If all other players still
in the round are protected by the
Handmaid, this card does nothing.

5: prince arnaud
As a social gadfly, Prince Arnaud was
not as distressed over his mother's arrest
as one would suppose. Since many women
clamor for his attention, he hopes to help
his sister find the same banal happiness
by playing the matchmaker.
When you discard Prince Arnaud,
choose one player still in the round
(including yourself). That player
discards his or her hand (do not
apply its effect) and draws a new
card. If the deck is empty, that
player draws the card that was
removed at the start of the round.
If all other players are protected
by the Handmaid, you must choose
yourself.

4: handmaid susannah
Few would trust a handmaid with
a letter of importance. Fewer still
understand Susannah's cleverness, or
her skilled ability at playing the foolish
handmaid. That the queen's confidante
and loyal servant escaped any attention
after the queen's arrest is a testament to
her clever mind.
When you discard the Handmaid,
you are immune to the effects of
other players' cards until the start
of your next turn. If all players
other than the player whose turn it
is are protected by Susannah, the
player must choose him- or herself
if possible.

3: baron talus
The scion of an esteemed house that has
long been a close ally of the royal family,
Baron Talus has a quiet and gentle
demeanor that conceals a man used to
being obeyed. His suggestions are treated
as if they came from the king himself.
When discarded, choose one other
player still in the round. You and
that player secretly compare your
hands. The player with the lower
rank is knocked out of the round.
In case of a tie, nothing happens. If
all other players still in the round
are protected by the Handmaid,
this card does nothing.

2: priest tomas
Open, honest, and uplifting, Father
Tomas always seeks out the opportunity
to do good. With the arrest of the queen,
he is often seen about the palace, acting
as confessor, counselor, and friend.
When you discard the Priest,
you can look at one other player's
hand. Do not reveal the hand to all
players.

1: guard odette
Charged with seeing to the security of
the royal family, Odette follows her
orders with persistence and diligence...
even though her mentor is said to
have drowned while fleeing arrest for
complicity in the queen's treason.
When you discard the Guard,
choose a player and name a card
(other than Guard). If that player
has that card, that player is
knocked out of the round. If all
other players still in the round are
protected by the Handmaid, this
card does nothing.

GAME NAME:
DOMINION

You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of
rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You
want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of
trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are
small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring
civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.
But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact
same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending
them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce
up your castle, and fill your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your
grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.
Donald X. Vaccar

Before the first game, remove the five sets of cards from their wrappings and place them in the card
tray. One side of the included inlay suggests a way to organize the cards. The opposite side allows
players to create an organization that fits their needs.
- 500 cards
- 130 Treasure cards
- 60 Copper 40 Silver 30 Gold
- 48 Victory cards
- 24 Estates 12 Duchies 12 Provinces
- 30 Curse cards 32 Randomizer cards 1 Trash card
- 7 blank cards
This is a game of building a deck of cards. The deck is your Dominion. It contains your resources,
victory points, and the things you can do. It starts out a small sad collection of Estates and Coppers,
but you hope by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold, Provinces, and the inhabitants
and structures of your castle and kingdom.
The player with the most victory points in his Deck at game end wins.

- 252 Kingdom cards
- 24 Action cards (10 of each)
Most kingdom cards are action
cards, but there are other kinds.
- 1 Victory card (12)

TREASURE CARDS:
Copper, Silver, and Gold cards are the
basic Treasure cards, and they are available
in every game. After each player takes 7
Copper cards, place the remaining Copper
cards and all of the Silver cards and Gold
cards in face-up piles in the Supply.

VICTORY CARDS:
Estate, Duchy, and Province cards are the
basic Victory cards, and they are available
in every game. After each player takes 3
Estate cards, place 12 each of the Estate,
Duchy, and Province cards in face-up piles
in the Supply in a 3 or 4 player game.
In a 2 player game, place only 8 of each
of these Victory cards in the Supply. Place
unused Victory cards back in the box.

CURSE CARDS & TRASH CARD:
Place 10 Curse cards in the Supply for a 2
player game, 20 Curse cards for 3 players,
and 30 Curse cards for 4 players. Return
unused Curse cards to the box. Curse
cards are used most often with specific
Action cards (e.g. Witch). If a player buys
a Curse card (0 cost), it goes in his own
discard pile, like any other gained card.
This, of course, will not often occur.
The Trash card marks the place where
players place cards trashed in the game.
Place the Treasure cards, Victory cards, Curse cards, and the Trash card in every game (players
may place them as shown or in any other arrangement that is convenient for them.
Note: Curse cards
are present in
every game,
however, they are
rarely used in the
basic game other
than with the
Witch card.
each player starts with 10 cards:
Each player
starts the
game with
the same
cards:
7 coppers
&
3 estates.
Each player
shuffles these
cards and places
them (his Deck)
face-down in his
play area (the
area near him
on the table).
Now, each
player draws
5 cards from
his Deck. These
cards are the
player's
hand.

KINGDOM CARDS:
In addition to the Trash, Treasure, Victory,
and Curse cards that are used in every
game, the players also select 10 Kingdom
cards and place 10 of each in face-up piles
on the table.
Exception: Kingdom Victory card piles
(e.g. Gardens) have the same number as
the Victory card piles (12 for a 3 or 4
player game and 8 for a 2 player game).
For the first game, we recommend using
the following 10 Kingdom cards: Cellar,
Market, Militia, Mine, Moat, Remodel,
Smithy, Village, Woodcutter, and
Workshop. At the end of the rules, we list
more suggestions for sets of 10 Kingdom
cards. Return Kingdom cards not chosen
for the game to the box.
In later games, players can choose the 10
Kingdom cards using any method they
agree on.
For example, the players can shuffle the
Randomizer cards for all Kingdom cards and
draw 10 to select the cards for the game. Or,
players can take turns selecting cards.
Players may also use the Randomizer cards
as Placeholders to mark the card piles so
empty piles are easily seen.
Place 10 sets of the 25 different Kingdom cards next to the Treasure, Victory, Curse, and Trash
cards to start each game. Thus, each game can have a different set of 10 cards. Kingdom cards
example of a player's play area during the game:
Deck cards played this turn Discard pile
(always face-down) (always face-up)
Players choose starting player
randomly or based on previous
game. Players take turns in
clockwise order.
Each turn, the player does the
A, B, and C phases in order:
A) Action phase
B) Buy phase
C) Clean-up phase
The player may play one action
card if he has one. This is
optional, even if the player has
an action card, he need not play
it. Action cards will allow
players to do extra things
during their turns.
As some action cards offer a
player additional actions, a
player may be able and choose
to play several action cards in a
turn. Players can play their
action cards left to right in their
play areas. In this way, they can
easily keep track of what and
how many extra things they
may do. The player will discard
these cards in the clean-up
phase (see below), and should
not be discarded prior to this.
Note: as the players begin the
game with no action cards, they
will be unable to play action
cards for at least the first two
turns.
+ X Card(s): must draw X more Cards immediately

STARTING PLAYER:
Randomly determine the starting player. When playing multiple
games, the starting player is the player to the left of the winner of
the last game. If there was a tie in the previous game, randomly
choose the starting player from the players that didn't win. Players
take turns in clockwise order.

TURN OVERVIEW:
Each turn has three phases (A, B, and C) in the order shown:
A) Action phase - the player may play an Action.
B) Buy phase - the player may buy a card.
C) Clean-up phase - the player must discard both played and
unplayed cards and draws five new cards.
After a player completes all three phases, his turn ends.

ACTION PHASE:
In the Action phase, the player may play one Action card. Action
cards are the Kingdom cards that say "Action" at the bottom of the
card. Since players do not start the game with any Action cards in
their initial Decks of 10 cards, a player will not have any Actions to
play during his first 2 turns. Normally, a player may play only one
Action card, but this number may be modified by the Action cards
that the player plays.
To play an Action, the player takes an Action card from his hand
and lays it face-up in his play area. He announces which card he is
playing and follows the instructions written on that card from top
to bottom. The player may still play an Action card even if he is not
able to do everything the Action card tells him to do; but the
player must do as much as he can. Furthermore, the player must
fully resolve an Action card before playing another one (if he is
able to play another Action card). Detailed information about
card abilities can be found in the card descriptions at the end of
these rules. Any Action cards played remain in the player's play
area until the Clean-up phase of the turn unless otherwise
indicated on the card.
The Action phase ends when the player cannot or chooses not to
play any more Action cards. Generally, a player can only play
Action cards during the Action phase of his turn. However,
Reaction cards are an exception to this rule as they can be used
at other times.
Common terms used on the Action cards:
"+X Card(s)"  the player immediately draws X number of cards from his
Deck. If there are not enough cards in his Deck, he draws as many as he
can, shuffles the Discard pile to form a new Deck, and then draws the
rest. If he still does not have enough cards left after forming a new Deck,
he just draws as many as he can.
7
+ X Action(s): can play X more
Actions in Action phase
If a card gives the player more
than one additional Action, it is
helpful to keep track of the
number of Actions he has
remaining out loud.
+ X : can spend X more coins
this turn
+1 Buy: can buy 1 more card in
Buy phase
Discard: put cards face-up in
your Discard pile
Trash: put card(s) in the Trash
pile
Gain: take a card and put it in
your Discard pile
Reveal: show card(s) and return
them to where they came from
Set Aside: put cards aside until
the instructions indicate where
they go
The player can gain one card
from the Supply by buying it -
paying the cost shown on the
card. The player pays in coins
from Treasure cards (the
number on the coin) and from
previously paid Action cards.
The player may use any
combination of Treasure cards
from his hand and coins shown
on Action cards played this
turn.
"+X Action(s)"  the player may play X number of additional Actions this
turn. +X Action(s) adds to the number of Actions that can be played in the
Action phase. It does not mean play another Action immediately. The
instructions on the current Action card must be completed before playing
any additional Actions. The player must complete all of his Actions before
he moves on to the Buy phase of his turn. If a card gives the player more
than one additional Action, he may keep track of the number of Actions he
has remaining out loud.
"+ X "  the player has X number of additional coins to spend in the Buy
phase. The player does not take additional Treasure cards for these coins.
"+1 Buy"  the player may buy an additional card from the Supply during
the Buy phase of his turn. +1 Buy adds to a player's potential Buys, it
does not allow the player to buy a card during the Action phase.
"Discard"  unless otherwise specified, discarded cards are from the player's
hand. When a player discards a card, he places the discarded card face-up
onto his Discard pile. When discarding several cards at once, the player
need not show all cards he is discarding to his opponents, but player may
need to show how many cards he is discarding (for example, when
playing the Cellar). The top card of a player's Discard pile is always visible.
"Trash"  when a player trashes a card, he places it in the Trash pile, not his
Discard pile. Trashed cards are not returned to the Supply and are not
available for purchase.
"Gain"  when a player gains a card, he takes the gained card (usually from
the Supply) and puts it onto his Discard pile (unless the card says to put
it elsewhere). The player does not get to use the card when he gains it.
"Reveal"  when a player reveals a card, he shows a card to all players and
then returns it to wherever it came from (unless instructed specifically to
put it elsewhere). If the player is required to reveal cards from the top of
his Deck, and he does not have enough cards, he shuffles in order to
reveal the required number of cards.
"Set Aside"  when a player sets aside a card, he places it face-up on the
table (unless otherwise indicated) without following any instructions on
the card. An Action that requires a player to set aside cards will instruct
him on what to do with these cards.

BUY PHASE:
In the Buy phase, the player can gain one card from the Supply by
paying its cost. Any card that is in the Supply may be purchased
(Treasure, Victory, Kingdom, and even Curse cards). The player
may not purchase cards from the Trash pile. Normally, a player
may buy only one card, but he may buy more if he played certain
cards earlier in his Action phase.
The cost of a card is in its lower left corner. The player may play
some or all of the Treasure cards from his hand to his play area
and add to their value the coins provided by Action cards played
this turn. The player may then gain any card in the Supply of equal
or lesser value. He takes the purchased card from its Supply pile
and places it face-up on his Discard pile. He my not use the ability
of the card when it is gained.
please visit our website:
www.riograndegames.com
Any Treasure cards played can
be placed in his player area
from left to right, adding them
to any cards previously played
this turn.
All these cards will be discarded
at the end of the turn, and
should not be discarded prior
to the Clean-up phase (see
below).
The player places all cards in his
play area onto his Discard pile.
This will include all Action cards
and Treasure cards he played
during this turn. He also places
all cards left in his hand onto
his Discard pile.
Draw 5 cards from his Deck.
The player's turn is over. Play
passes clockwise.
Game end
1) Province card pile is empty
or
2) any 3 Supply piles are empty
Players count their victory
points.
Most victory points wins.
Ties go to the player with the
fewest turns

If the player has multiple Buys, he combines Treasure cards and
any coins available from Action cards to pay for all of the
purchases. For example, if Tyler has +1 Buy and 6 coins provided
by two Gold cards, he can buy a Cellar costing 2, placing it face-up
in his Discard pile. Then, he can buy a Smithy with the remaining
4 coins and place that face-up in his Discard pile. If he wants to
use all 6 coins to buy one card, he can buy a Copper (for free) with
his second Buy or not buy a second card. Players do not have to
use any or all of their Buys.
The Treasure cards remain in the play area until the Clean-up
phase. Treasure cards will be used multiple times during the game.
Although they are discarded during the Clean-up phase, the player
will draw them again as his Discard pile is shuffled into a new
Deck. Thus, Treasure cards are a source of income, not a resource
that is used up when played. When played, Coppers are worth
1 coin, Silvers are worth 2 coins, and Golds are worth 3 coins.

CLEAN-UP PHASE:
All cards gained this turn should already be in the player's Discard
pile. The player places any cards that are in his play area (Action
cards that have been played in the Action phase as well as Treasure
cards that have been played in the Buy phase) and any cards
remaining in his hand onto his Discard pile. Although the player
need not show the cards remaining in his hand to his opponents,
since he places the cards in the Discard pile face-up, his opponents
will always be able to see the top-most card of his Discard pile.
Then, the player draws a new hand of 5 cards from his Deck. If
there are not enough cards in his Deck, he draws as many as he
can, shuffles his Discard pile to form a new face-down Deck, and
then draws the rest of his new hand.
Once the player has drawn a new hand of 5 cards, the next player
starts his turn. To speed play, players may begin their turns while
previous players are completing their Clean-up phases. When
someone plays an Attack card, the players must complete their
Clean-up phases in order to properly resolve the Attack.
The game ends at the end of any player's turn when either:
1) the Supply pile of Province cards is empty or
2) any 3 Supply piles are empty.
Each player puts all of his cards into his Deck and counts the
victory points on all the cards he has.
The player with the most victory points wins. If the highest
scores are tied at the end of the game, the tied player who has
had the fewest turns wins the game. If the tied players have had
the same number of turns, they rejoice in their shared victory.
The first few turns - how your first game might go

Shuffle your starting 10 cards (7 Coppers & 3 Estates) and place them face-down as your Deck. Draw the top
5 cards as your starting hand. In this example, you have 1 Estate & 4 Coppers. The rest remain as your Deck.

Deck hand cards cards played Discard pile
As you have no action cards to start the game, you skip the action phase and go directly to the buy phase,
where you will buy most of your cards. You play 4 Copper cards from your hand to buy a
Remodel card (cost = 4 Coins) from the supply, placing it in your Discard pile. from the supply

After completing your Buy, you go to the Clean-up phase. Here you place the cards
you played on the discard pile and the cards left in your hand there as well.

Finally, you draw 5 cards from your Deck for your next turn. This time, you get 2 Estates and 3 Coppers.
Your 1st turn is over and the opponent on your left begins his turn.
After your opponents complete their turns, it is your 2nd turn. Again, you have no action cards,
so you go directly to the Buy phase. This time, you play your 3 Copper cards
to Buy a Silver card, placing it on your Discard pile.
In your Clean-up phase, you place the 3 Coppers you played on your Discard pile
and the 2 Estate cards left in your hand there as well.
Finally, you draw 5 cards from your Deck for your next turn. As your Deck is empty, so you shuffle
your Discard pile, place it face-down, and draw 5 cards from it. This time, you get 1 Estate, 1 Silver,
2 Coppers, and 1 Remodel. Your 2nd turn is over and the opponent on your left begins his turn.

After your opponents complete their turns, you begin your 3rd turn with the Action phase and play the Remodel
card. You decide to trash the Estate from your hand and Gain a Smithy from the
supply (cost = 4 Coins = cost of Estate + 2 Coins), placing it on your Discard pile.
You have 4 Coins in your hand for the Buy phase. You play the 4 Coins (2 Copper cards and 1 Silver card) and decide
to Buy a Militia card from the Supply, placing it in your Discard pile.
from the supply
After completing your Buy, you go to the Clean-up phase.
Here you place the cards you played on the discard pile.
Finally, you draw 5 cards from your Deck for your next turn. This time, you get 2 Estates and 3 Coppers.
Your 3rd turn is over and the opponent on your left begins his turn.
Each player has his own
Dominion, built from the cards
in the supply.
Shuffle only when new cards
needed.
A player does not shuffle his
discard pile until all cards in his
Deck have been drawn or
revealed.
Gained cards go on the player's
discard pile.
All hand and played cards are
discarded at the end of a turn.
Players may count cards in
Decks and Supply piles and may
look at cards in Trash.
Use turn order to resolve card
affects.
Player allowed at least 1 Action
and 1 Buy.
All Action cards alter the rules
in some way.
Players may not add coins to
increase the affect of an Action
beyond the instructions.
Each player has his own Dominion, which he builds from cards in
the supply. During the game, a player's cards are usually in three
parts: his Deck (which he draws cards from), his hand, and his
Discard pile. The player draws cards from his own Deck and
discards cards to his own Discard pile. When his Deck is exhausted
and the player needs to draw or reveal cards from his Deck, he
shuffles his Discard pile to reform his Deck. He does not shuffle
his Discard pile until he needs to reveal or draw a card from his
Deck and cannot. At any point in the game, if a player has to draw
or reveal more cards than are remaining in his Deck, he must draw
or reveal as many as he can and then shuffle his face-up Discard
pile to form a new face-down Deck. Then, he draws or reveals the
remaining number of cards from his newly shuffled Deck.
A player places cards he Buys or otherwise acquires during the
game on his Discard pile unless he is specifically directed to place
them elsewhere.
At the end of a player's turn, he places all the cards he played and
those still in his hand on his Discard pile.
A player is allowed to count how many cards are left in his Deck,
but not in his Discard pile. A player may not look through his Deck
or his Discard pile. A player may look through the Trash pile, and
players may count the number of cards left in any pile in the
Supply.
If an ability of a card affects multiple players, and the order
matters, resolve that ability for each affected player in turn order,
starting with the player whose turn it is.
During each turn, a player is allowed 1 Action and 1 Buy, but may
be entitled to more based on Action cards played. The instructions
written on all the action cards alter the rules of the game by, for
example, allowing the player to draw more cards from his Deck,
play more Action cards in the Action phase, use more coins for the
Buy phase, Buy extra cards in the Buy phase, and so on.
When an Action card allows a player to gain a card costing up to
a certain value, he may not add coins from his hand or other
action cards to gain a higher-valued card.
Adventurer  If you have to shuffle in the middle, shuffle. Don't
shuffle in the revealed cards as these cards do not go to the
Discard pile until you have finished revealing cards. If you run
out of cards after shuffling and still only have one Treasure, you
get just that one Treasure.
Bureaucrat  If you have no cards left in your Deck when you
play this card, the Silver you gain will become the only card in
your Deck. Similarly, if another player has no cards in his Deck,
the Victory card he puts on top will become the only card in his
Deck.
Cellar  You can't discard Cellar to itself, since it isn't in your
hand any longer when you resolve it. You choose what cards to
discard and discard them all at once. You only draw cards after
you have discarded. If you have to shuffle to do the drawing, the
discarded cards will end up shuffled into your new Deck.
Chancellor  You must resolve the Chancellor (decide whether or
not to discard your Deck by flipping it into your Discard pile)
before doing other things on your turn, like deciding what to
buy or playing another Action card. You may not look through
your Deck as you discard it.
Chapel  You can't trash the Chapel itself since it isn't in your
hand when you resolve it. You could trash a different Chapel card
if that card were in your hand.
Council Room  The other players must draw a card whether
they want to or not. All players should shuffle as necessary.
Feast  The gained card goes into your Discard pile. It has to be a
card from the Supply. You cannot use coins from Treasures or
previous Actions (like the Market) to increase the cost of the
card that you gain. If you use Throne Room on Feast, you will
gain two cards, even though you can only trash Feast once.
Gaining the card isn't contingent on trashing Feast; they're just
two things that the card tries to make you do.
Festival  If you are playing multiple Festivals, keep a careful
count of your Actions. Say how many you have left out loud; this
trick works every time (i.e. "I'm playing the Festival and now
have two Actions remaining. I play a Market and have two
Actions remaining. I play another Festival and now have three
Actions remaining....").
Gardens  This Kingdom card is a Victory card, not an Action
card. It does nothing until the end of the game, when it is worth
1 victory point per 10 cards in your Deck (counting all of your
cards  your Discard pile and hand are combined with your Deck
before scoring). Round down; if you have 39 cards, Gardens is
worth 3 victory points. During set-up, place 12 Gardens in the
Supply for a 3 or 4 player game and 8 in the Supply for a 2
player game.
Laboratory  Draw two cards. You may play another Action card
during your Action phase.
Library  If you have to shuffle in the middle, the set-aside cards
are not shuffled into the new Deck. They will be discarded when
you have finished drawing cards. If you run out of cards even
after shuffling, you just get however many there were. You are
not obligated to set aside Actions  you just have the option to
do so. If you have 7 or more cards in hand after you play the
Library, you don't draw any cards.
Market  Draw a card. You may play another Action card during
your Action phase. During your Buy phase, you may buy an
additional card from the supply, and add one coin to the total
value of the Treasure cards played.
Militia  The attacked players discard cards until they have only
3 cards in hand. Players who had 3 or fewer cards in hand when
Militia was played do not discard any cards.
Mine  Generally, you can trash a Copper card and gain a Silver,
or trash a Silver card and gain a Gold. However, you could also
trash a Treasure to gain the same Treasure or a cheaper one. The
gained card goes in your hand; thus, you can spend it the same
turn. If you don't have a Treasure card in your hand to trash, you
can't gain anything.
Moat  An Attack card is one that says "Attack" on the bottom
line (usually, "Action - Attack"). When someone else plays an
Attack card, you may reveal the Moat by showing it from your
hand to the other players and then returning it to your hand
(before the Attack card resolves). You are then unaffected by that
Attack card. You won't gain a Curse because of a Witch or reveal
a card to a Spy, and so on. It's just like you aren't in the game for
purposes of resolving that Attack. Moat doesn't stop anything
an Attack does to other players or to the player of the Attack; for
example, if everyone else Moats a Witch, the person who played
it still gets to draw 2 cards. Moat can also be played on your
turn as an Action to draw 2 cards.
Moneylender  If you do not have a Copper in your hand to
trash, you don't get the +3 coins to spend in the Buy phase.
Remodel  You cannot trash the Remodel as it isn't in your hand
when you resolve it (you can trash a different Remodel card
from your hand). If you do not have a card to trash, you cannot
gain a card from the Remodel. The gained card goes in your
Discard pile. You can only gain cards from the Supply. The gained
card need not cost exactly 2 coins more than the trashed card; it
can cost that much or any amount less. You cannot use coins
from Treasures or previous Actions (like the Market) to increase
the cost of the card you gain. You can trash a card to gain a copy
of the same card.
Smithy  Draw three cards.
Spy  Spy causes all players, including the one who played it, to
reveal the top card of their Deck. Note that you draw your card
for playing Spy before any cards are revealed. Anyone who does
not have any cards left in their Deck shuffles in order to have
something to reveal. Anyone who still has no cards to reveal
doesn't reveal one. If players care about the order in which
things happen for this, you do yourself first, then each other
player in turn order. Revealed cards that aren't discarded are
returned to the top of their players' Decks.
Thief  A player with just one card left reveals that last card and
then shuffles to get the other card to reveal (without including
the revealed card); a player with no cards left shuffles to get both
of them. A player who still doesn't have two cards to reveal after
shuffling just reveals what he can. Each player trashes one
Treasure card at most, of the attacker's choice from the two
revealed cards, and then you gain any of the trashed cards that
you want. You can only take Treasures just trashednot ones
trashed on previous turns. You can take none of them, all of
them, or anything in between. Put the Treasures you decided to
gain into your Discard pile. The ones you choose not to gain stay
in the Trash pile.
Throne Room  You pick another Action card in your hand, play
it, and play it again. The second use of the Action card doesn't
use up any extra Actions you have. You completely resolve
playing the Action the first time before playing it the second
time. If you Throne Room a Throne Room, you play an Action,
doing it twice, and then play another Action and do it twice; you
do not resolve an Action four times. If you Throne Room a card
that gives you +1 Action, such as Market, you will end up with 2

Actions left afterwards, which is tricky, because if you'd just
played Market twice you'd only have 1 Action left afterwards.
Remember to count the number of Actions you have remaining
out loud to keep from getting confused! You cannot play any
other Actions in between playing the Throne Roomed Action
twice.
Village  If you're playing multiple Villages, keep a careful count
of your Actions. Say how many you have left out loud; this trick
works every time.
Witch  If there aren't enough Curses left to go around when
you play the Witch, you deal them out in turn order  starting
with the player after you. If you play Witch with no Curses
remaining, you will still draw 2 cards. A player gaining a Curse
puts it face-up into his Discard pile.
Woodcutter  During your Buy phase, you add two coins to the
total value of the Treasure cards played, and you may buy an
additional card from the Supply.
Workshop  The card you gain is put into your Discard pile. It
has to be a card from the Supply. You cannot use coins from
Treasures or previous Actions (like the Market) to increase the
cost of the card you may gain.

GAME NAME:
TICKET TO RIDE

On a blustery autumn evening five old friends met in the backroom of one of the city's oldest and most private clubs. Each had
traveled a long distance  from all corners of the world  to meet on this very specific day... October 2, 1900  28 years to the
day that the London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a 20,000 bet that he could travel Around the World in 80 Days.
When the story of Fogg's triumphant journey filled all the newspapers of the day, the five attended University together. Inspired by
his impetuous gamble, and a few pints from the local pub, the group commemorated his circumnavigation with a more modest excursion and wager  a bottle of good claret to the first to make it to Le Procope in Paris.
Each succeeding year, they met to celebrate the anniversary and pay tribute to Fogg. And each year a new expedition (always more
difficult) with a new wager (always more expensive) was proposed. Now at the dawn of the century it was time for a new impossible journey. The stakes: $1 Million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see which of them could travel by rail to the
most cities in North America  in just 7 days. The journey would begin immediately...
Ticket to Ride is a cross-country train adventure. Players compete to connect different cities by laying claim to railway routes on a
map of North America.
For 2 - 5 players
ages 8 and above
30 - 60 minutes

COMPONENTS:
- 1 Board map of North American train routes
- 240 Colored Train Cars (45 each in Blue, Red, Green, Yellow and Black, plus some extra replacement cars in each color)
- 144 Illustrated cards:
- 1 Promotional card for additional maps
- 1 Days of Wonder Promotional card
- 5 Wooden Scoring Markers (1 for each player in Blue, Red, Green, Yellow
and Black)
- 1 Rules booklet
- 1 Days of Wonder Online access number

SETTING UP THE GAME:
Place the board map in the center of the table. Each player takes a set of 45 Colored
Train Cars along with its matching Scoring Marker. Each player places his Scoring
Marker on Start on the Scoring Track running along the map's border. Throughout
the game, each time a player scores points, he will advance his marker accordingly.
Shuffle the Train Car cards and deal a starting hand of 4 cards to each player ?.
Place the remaining deck of Train Car cards near the board and turn the top five cards
from the deck face-up.
Place the Longest Path Bonus card face up next to the board.
Shuffle the Destination Ticket cards and deal 3 cards to each player. Each player
looks at their Destination Tickets and decides which ones they wish to keep. A player
must keep at least two, but may keep all three if he chooses. Any returned cards are
placed on the bottom of the Destination Ticket deck. This deck is then placed next to the
board. Players keep their Destination Tickets secret until the end of the game.
You are now ready to begin.

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
The object of the game is to score the highest number of total points. Points can be
scored by:
- Claiming a Route between two adjacent cities on the map;
- Successfully completing a Continuous Path of routes between two cities listed on your Destination Ticket(s);
- Completing the Longest Continuous Path of routes.
Points are lost if you do not successfully complete the route given on the Destination Ticket(s) you kept.

THE GAME TURN:
The player who is the most experienced traveler goes first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, each player taking one turn at a time until
the game ends. On his turn, a player must perform one (and only one) of the following three actions:

- 110 Train Car cards (12 each of Box, Passenger, Tanker, Reefer, Freight, Hopper, Coal, and Caboose cars, plus 14 Locomotives)
- 30 Destination Ticket cards
- 1 Summary card
- 1 Longest Continuous Path Bonus card

DRAW TRAIN CARDS:
The player may draw 2 Train Car cards. He may take any one of the face-up cards or he may draw the top card from the
deck (this is a blind draw). If he draws a face up card, he immediately turns a replacement card face-up from the deck. He then draws his second
card, either from the face up cards or from the top of the deck. (See Train Car Cards for special rules for Locomotive cards).
Claim a Route  The player may claim a route on the board by playing a set of Train Car cards that match the color and length of the route and
then placing one of his colored trains on each space of this route. He then records his score by moving his Scoring Marker the appropriate number
of spaces (see Route Scoring Table) along the Scoring Track on the board.

DRAW DESTINATION TICKETS:
The player draws 3 Destination Tickets from the top of the deck. He must keep at least one of them, but he may keep
two or all three if he chooses. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the deck.

TRAIN CAR CARDS:
There are 8 types of regular Train Car cards, plus Locomotive cars. The colors of each type of Train Car card match various routes
between cities on the board  Purple, Blue, Orange, White, Green, Yellow, Black, and
Red.
Locomotives are Multi-colored and act as a wild card that can be part of any set of
cards when claiming a route. If a Locomotive card is one of the five face-up cards, the
player who draws it may only draw one card, instead of two. If, after having drawn one
card the replacement card is a Locomotive, the player cannot take it. If at any time, three
of the five face-up cards are Locomotives, all five cards are immediately discarded and
five new ones are turned face-up to replace them.
Note: If a player is lucky enough to get a Locomotive from the top of the deck in a blind
draw, it stills counts as a single card and he may still draw a total of two cards that turn.
A player may have any number of cards in his hand at any time.
When the deck is exhausted, the discards are reshuffled into a new draw pile deck. The
cards should be shuffled thoroughly, since all the cards have been discarded in sets.
In the unlikely event that there are no cards left in the deck and there are no discards
(because players are hoarding many cards in their hands), a player cannot draw Train
Car cards. Instead he may only claim a route or draw Destination Ticket cards.

CLAIMING ROUTES:
To claim a route, a player must play a set of cards equal to the number of spaces in the
route. A set of cards must be of the same type. Most routes require a specific type of set.
For example a Blue route must be claimed using blue-colored Passenger Car cards. Some
routes  those that are Gray colored  can be claimed using a set of cards of any one color.
When a route is claimed, the player places one of his plastic trains in each of the spaces
of the route. All the cards in the set used to claim the route are then discarded.
A player may claim any open route on the board. He is never required to
connect to any of his previously played routes. A player may only claim
a maximum of one route, hence connect two adjacent cities, never more,
on his turn.
Some cities are connected by Double-Routes. One player cannot claim
both routes to the same cities.
Important Note: In 2 or 3 player games, only one of the Double-Routes
can be used. A player can claim either of the two routes between cities, but
the other route is then closed to other players.

To claim the route from Montral
to Toronto, a player could use any
set of Train Car cards, as a long
as they are the same type.
Example 2
To claim the route from Montral
to New York, a player would need
a set of three Blue Passenger
Car cards.


ROUTE SCORING TABLE:
When a player claims a route, he records the points he receives by
moving his Scoring Marker on the Scoring Track:

DRAWING DESTINATION TICKET CARDS:
A player can use his turn to draw more Destination Ticket cards. To do so, he draws 3 new cards from the top of the Destination Ticket Deck. He must
keep at least one of the cards, but may also keep two or all three if he chooses. If there are less than 3 Destination Tickets left in the deck, the player
only draws the cards that are available. Any returned cards are placed on the bottom of the Destination Ticket Deck.
Each Destination Ticket includes the name of two cities on the map and a Point Value. If a player successfully completes a series of routes that connect
the two cities, they will add the amount of points indicated on the Destination Ticket to their point totals at the end of the game. If they do not
successfully connect the two cities, they deduct the amount of points indicated.
Destination Tickets are kept secret from other players until the game's final scoring. A player may have any number of Destination Ticket cards during
the game.

GAME END:
When one player's stock of colored plastic trains gets down to only 0,1 or 2 trains left at the end of his turn, each player, including that player, gets
one final turn. The game then ends and players calculate their final scores.

CALCULATING SCORES:
Players should have already accounted for the points earned as they completed different routes. To make sure no mistakes were made, you may
want to re-count the points for each player's routes.
Players should then reveal all their Destination Tickets and add (or subtract) the value of their Destination Tickets still in hand, based on whether
they successfully (or not) connected those cities together.
The player who has the Longest Continuous Path of routes receives this special bonus card and adds 10 points to his score. When evaluating and
comparing path lengths, only take into account continuous lines of plastic trains of the same color. A continuous path may include loops, and pass
through the same city several times, but a given plastic train may never be used twice in the same continuous path. In the case of a tie for the longest
path, all tied players score the 10 point bonus.
The player with the most points wins the game. If two or more players are tied for the most points, the player who has completed the most Destination
Tickets wins. In the unlikely event that they are still tied, the player with the Longest Continuous Path card wins.

GAME NAME:
AZUL

GAME SETUP:
1. Give each player a player board (A). Flip your board to the side
with the colored wall. (See Variant Play to play with the gray
side of the player board). Each player must use the same side.
2. Take 1 scoring marker (B) and place it on space "0" of your
score track.
3. Place the Factory displays (C) in a circle around the
center of the table:
In a 2-player game, place 5 Factory displays.
In a 3-player game, place 7 Factory displays.
In a 4-player game, place 9 Factory displays.
4. Fill the bag (D) with the 100 tiles (20 of each color) (E).
5. The player who most recently visited Portugal takes the
starting player marker (F) and then fills each Factory
display with exactly 4 tiles randomly drawn from the bag.
Return any unused player boards, scoring markers and Factory
displays to the box.

Introduced by the Moors, azulejos (originally white and blue ceramic tiles)
were fully embraced by the Portuguese, when their king Manuel I, on a
visit to the Alhambra palace in Southern Spain, was mesmerized by the
stunning beauty of the Moorish decorative tiles. The king, awestruck by
the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own
palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. Azul brings you,
a tile laying artist, to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.
A GAME BY MICHAEL KIESLING

OBJECT OF THE GAME:
To be the player with the most points at the end of the game.
The game ends after the round in which at least one player has
completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles on her wall.

GAMEPLAY:
The game is played over multiple rounds, each of which is
composed of three phases:
A. Factory offer
B. Wall-tiling
C. Preparing the next round
A. Factory offer
The starting player places the starting player marker in the
center of the table and then takes the first turn. Play then
continues clockwise.
On your turn, you must pick tiles in one of the following ways:
EITHER
a) Pick all tiles of the same color from any one Factory display
and then move the remaining tiles from this Factory display
to the center of the table.
OR
b) Pick all tiles of the same color from the center of the table.
If you are the first player in this round to pick tiles from the
center of the table, also take the starting player marker and
place it onto the leftmost free space of your floor line.
1. On his turn, Peter picks
the 2 black tiles from a
Factory display and places
the remaining tiles in the
center of the table.
2. Martin picks the yellow
tile from a Factory display
and places the remaining
3 red tiles in the center
of the table.
3. Then, Andrea picks these 3 red
tiles from the center of the table. As
she is the first one to pick from the
center, she also takes the starting
player marker and places it on the
leftmost space of her floor line.
First turns example
Then, add the tiles you picked to one of the 5 pattern lines on
your player board (the first line has 1 space to hold 1 tile, the fifth
line has 5).
Place the tiles, one by one, from right
to left in your chosen pattern line.
If the pattern line already
holds tiles, you may only
add tiles of the same color to it.
Once all spaces of a pattern line are
filled, that line is considered complete. If you have picked up
more tiles than you can place in your chosen pattern line, you
must place the excess tiles in the floor line (see Floor line).
Your goal in this phase is to complete as many of your pattern
lines as you can, because during the following Wall-tiling phase,
you will only be able to move tiles from complete pattern lines to
their corresponding lines on your wall to score points.
Place tiles from right to left.

In all later rounds, you must also comply with the following
rule: You are not allowed to place tiles of a certain color in
a pattern line whose corresponding line of your wall already
holds a tile of that color.
Floor line
Any tiles you have picked that you cannot or do not want to place
according to the rules, you must place in your floor line, filling
its spaces from left to right. These tiles are considered as having
fallen on the floor and give minus points in the Wall-tiling phase.
If all spaces of your floor line are occupied, return any further
fallen tiles to the lid of the game box to store them for now.
This phase ends when the center of the table AND all Factory
displays contain no more tiles.
Then, continue with the Wall-tiling phase.
Andrea picks 2 yellow tiles from a Factory display.
She is not allowed to place them in her second or third pattern line, as
their corresponding wall lines each have a yellow tile.
She may not place them in the fourth pattern line either, as there is
already 1 blue tile and she may not add tiles of a different color to it.
She may, however, place 1 of them in the first pattern line and the excess
tile in the floor line.
Or she may place both tiles in the fifth pattern line.
She may even choose to place both tiles in the floor line.
Peter's second pattern line is complete with 2 red tiles. So he
moves the rightmost tile of this pattern line over to the red space
on the wall (and immediately scores 1 point, see Scoring).
As the third pattern line is not complete, he ignores it.
From his complete fourth pattern line, he moves the rightmost
blue tile over to the blue space on the wall (and scores 1 point
immediately).
He ignores the fifth pattern line, as it is not complete.
Afterwards, he removes the remaining tiles from the second and
fourth pattern lines and places them in the lid of the game box.
The tiles in his third and fifth pattern lines stay on his board.

COMPLETE WALL-TILING:
This phase can be carried out by all players simultaneously,
as they move tiles from their complete pattern lines over to
their walls.
Go through your pattern
lines from top to bottom.
Move the rightmost tile of
each complete line to the
space of the same color in
the corresponding line of
your wall. Each time you
move a tile, score points immediately (see Scoring).
Then, remove all tiles from any pattern lines that now
have no tile in the rightmost space. Place them into the
lid of the game box to store them for now.
Once that is done, any remaining tiles on the pattern lines
stay on your player board for the next round.
Finally, at the end of the Wall-tiling phase, check if you have any
tiles in your floor line. For each tile in your floor line, you lose
the number of points indicated directly above it. Adjust your
scoring marker on your score track accordingly (however, you
can never drop below 0 points).
Afterwards, remove all tiles in your floor line and place them
into the lid of the game box. Note: If you have the starting player
marker in your floor line, it counts as a normal tile there. But
instead of placing it in the lid, place it in front of you.
PREPARING THE NEXT ROUND:
If nobody has completed a horizontal line of 5 consecutive tiles
on her wall yet (see End of the game), prepare the next round.
The player with the starting player marker refills each of the
Factory displays with 4 tiles from the bag as in the setup. If the
bag is empty, refill it with all the tiles that you have placed in
the lid of the game box and then continue filling the remaining
Factory displays. Then, start the new round.
In the rare case that you run out of tiles again while there are
none left in the lid, start the new round as usual even though
not all Factory displays are properly filled.
Peter loses a total of 8 points as he has 4 tiles and the starting player
marker in his floor line.

SCORING:
Each tile you move over to your wall is always placed on the
space matching its color and immediately scores as follows:
If there are no tiles directly
adjacent (vertically or
horizontally) to the newly
placed tile, gain 1 point
on the score track.
If there are any tiles adjacent, however, do the following:
First check if there are 1 or more tiles horizontally linked
to the newly placed tile. If so, count all these linked tiles
(including the newly placed one) and gain that many points.
Then check if there are 1 or more tiles vertically linked to the
newly placed tile. If so, count all these linked tiles (including
the newly placed tile) and gain that many points.
Placing the
red tile gives
you 1 point.
In this example, placing the
yellow tile gives you not only
4 points for the horizontally
linked tiles but also 3 points
for the vertical ones.
In this example, placing the
yellow tile gives you 3 points
for the 3 horizontally
linked tiles (including
the newly placed
yellow tile).
In this example, placing the blue
tile gives you 3 points for the
vertically linked tiles.

END OF THE GAME:
The game ends right after the Wall-tiling phase in which at least
one player has completed at least one horizontal line of
5 consecutive tiles on her wall.
Once the game has ended, score additional points if you have
achieved the following goals:
 Gain 2 points for each complete horizontal line of
5 consecutive tiles on
your wall.
 Gain 7 points for each
complete vertical line of
5 consecutive tiles on
your wall.
 Gain 10 points for each
color of which you have
placed all 5 tiles on your wall.
The player with the most points on her score track wins the
game. In the case of a tie, the
tied player with more complete
horizontal lines wins the game.
If that does not break the tie,
the victory is shared.

VARIANT PLAY:
For a slightly different game, use the gray
side of the player boards. Rules are exactly
the same as in the normal game, except that
when you move a tile from a pattern line to
the wall, you may place it on any space of
its corresponding wall line. However, as the
game progresses, in each of the 5 vertical
lines of your wall, no color may appear more than once. Also keep
in mind that in each horizontal line, no color may appear more
than once either.
Special case: In the wall-tiling phase, it may happen that you are
not able to move the rightmost tile of a certain pattern line over
to the wall because there is no valid space left for it. In this case,
you must immediately place all tiles of that pattern line in your
floor line (see Floor line).
